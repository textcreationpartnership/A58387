            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>'TIS a ſtrange and almoſt incomprehenſible thing, that at this time there ſhould be found ſo many diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Perſons among us; when but a little while ſince, the whole Body of Proteſtants appeared ſo unanimous, <hi>viz.</hi> at the beginning of the miraculous Revolution. Though it hath already retrieved the State from Ruine, and will without doubt prove its Happineſs; it might eaſily be gueſs'd, that thoſe who had contributed to the overthrow of the Laws, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the Reward they had ſo juſtly deſerved, would make up a Body of Malecontents, and that their Numbers would be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. 'Tis notorious alſo, that in all times, thoſe who think they are not conſidered or treated according to the Juſtice of their Merit, are ready to murmur againſt the Government; and the Ambition that poſſeſſes them, renders them every where, a Race of diſcontented Perſons. But whatever difference of Principles there might be among Proteſtants, the fear of their common danger having reunited them, and made their Intereſts the ſame with thoſe of the State and Religion, which they ſaw equally expos'd to inevitable Ruine, there ſeem'd but ſmall ground to apprehend, that as ſoon as the Fright was over, there ſhould ſtill be found a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Men, whom their old Animoſities, and habitual Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, would engage in diſaffection and murmuring againſt the Government. And yet it is but too true, that ſcarce did the State and Religion begin to breath again, but immediately there appeared a Party, who made it appear by their ſnarling, that what fill'd the generality of Men with Joy, and made them give Thanks to God, afforded them very ſmall Satisfaction. I pretend not to tax the whole Body of the <hi>Engliſh Church:</hi> It is well enough known, that as their Settlement was
<pb facs="tcp:55979:5"/> furiouſly ſtruck at by Popery triumphant, and obſerving no kind of meaſures, her principal Members, as well as the generality of thoſe that reſort under her, have, and ſtill do witneſs their Zeal for the Government, which God has been pleaſed to eſtabliſh among us. I ſpeak only of ſome certain Members of this Church, whom the Court has long employed in overthrowing, by their Maxims, the Foundations of the Publick Liberty, in order to a ſure Eſtabliſhment of Popery. Thoſe Diſciples of <hi>L'Eſtrange,</hi> the Penſioner and Drudge of a Popiſh Court, no ſooner perceived that what was like to happen upon <hi>James the Second</hi>'s Deſertion, would extremely expoſe them, as Men that had betrayed the Intereſts of their Religion and the Government, by Maxims which they had maintained with ſo much boldneſs, every where began to publiſb their diſcontent, and ſtill endeavour to inſpire the ſame into the People, as founded upon pure Tenderneſs of Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be denied, but that hitherto the Government has ſhewed an extraordinary lenity, in reducing them to Reaſon, whom Danger ſeemed to have made wiſer. The method and careful management which has been made uſe of to obviate whatſoever might afford them the leaſt Jealouſie, or give them the leaſt trouble, is an evident Mark hereof. But in fine, ſince they continue in their Miſtakes notwithſtanding all this care and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that nothing will ſatisfie them; what can be more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently undertaken, than to prevent the pernicious Effects which their Example, and the Maxims wherewith they are leavened, might produce in the minds of the People.

                     </gap> Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction already, that the Publick is well aware they know not themſelves what they would be at; for how free ſoever they may be to diſperſe their Murmurs and Diſaffection, yet probably there is ſcarce one among them that would have <hi>James II.</hi> recalled; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed would it be ſo difficult a thing for them to find him out, in caſe their Conſciences link'd them ſo cloſely to him, as they would make us believe.</p>
                  <p>But we may have alſo another ſatisfaction in this Point; which is, That in examining their Maxims in good earneſt, we may make it appear, That they know not themſelves what they affirm; and that the Opinions they have ſo long maintained, concerning the Nature of Government in <hi>general,</hi> and that of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>particular,</hi> are properly and truly a Hereſie in Matters of State. Let no Man wonder that I call this Opinion of ſome of the Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> a
<pb facs="tcp:55979:5"/> Political or State-Hereſie. Their Opinions reſpect a Political Queſtion truly ſuch; but theſe Gentlemen have been pleaſed to mould it into an Article of Faith, forſooth, of the <hi>Church of England;</hi> and their aim was to make that paſs for an Article of the Law, which indeed was no better than a dangerous Error in Policy. And truly all the Characters of Hereſie ſo fitly ſuit theſe their Sentiments, that it is a hard thing to reſiſt the Temptation of giving them that Title. Theſe Aſſertions are a perfect Novelty in Policy, as well as Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Some late Writers have fully made out, That their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are little more than of fifty years ſtanding. And it is as true, that they are the fruits of Ambition. Conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all thoſe that ever undertook the defence of them, did not do it, to raiſe themſelves in the Church, and to be promoted to higher dignities than they could hope for from their merit. Truth never employs any thing for its own defence, but the light and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which are ſo connatural to it; but would to God the Authors and Defenders of theſe Opinions had never practiſed any violent means, to make their Party triumphant, by which both Church and State have equally ſuffered, and been both reduc'd to within two inches of their utter Ruine and Deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs theſe Gentlemen have endeavoured to delude the World, by alledging the Holy Scripture and Fathers, in favour of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But herein they have behaved themſelves as the Hereticks do, in citing the Scripture and Tradition in defence of their Novelties; that is to ſay, wreſting them to their own Perdition, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith; and making the Father<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ſpeak what beſt pleaſeth them, rendring them as pliable as the Sound of Bells, which (according to the Proverb) do tink as the Fool is pleaſed to think. And this is that which I undertake to juſtifie and make out, by my Reflections on this Matter.</p>
                  <p>To perform this with ſome method, I ſhall firſt of all explain the Original of the Power of Kings. Secondly, I ſhall examine the Extent of that Power. And Thirdl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, I ſhall conſider the Remedy that may be juſtly oppoſed againſt the Abuſe of it. And in the ſequel, ſhall make it my buſineſs to apply theſe general Matters to moſt of the Weſtern Kingdoms; and ſhall make it evident, That there is no pretext at all for the vaſt Pretenſions of thoſe, who ſet no bounds to the Power of Kings, and who believe that nothing but a Stoical and invincible Patience, can lawfully be oppoſed to their Injuſtice and Tyranny. And for as much as in examining theſe three Articles, I ſhall be obliged to oppoſe the Prejudices of ſome New Divines, I
<pb facs="tcp:55979:6"/> think my ſelf bound to advertiſe the Reader, That it is not againſt their Character, but againſt their Opinions, that I ſet my ſelf; and that I do not in the leaſt pretend, by entring into the Liſts with them about a Political Queſtion, to derogate in the leaſt from their Authority, or to render their knowledg in Theological Queſtions ſuſpected. <hi>Tractent Fabrilia Fabri,</hi> Let Smiths keep to their own Anvil; for by their diſregarding of this Proverb, they have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and loſt themſelves. They have cut the King lumping Penny-worths out of the Rights of the People, and imprudently made way for the Eſtabliſhing of that Tyranny, which would infallibly, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, have deſtroyed their Religion. We muſt therefore, if it be poſſible, oblige theſe Gentlemen to permit others to enjoy their Rights, and then the World will be happy. I am not ignorant, that there be many among thoſe, who are dipt in this Opinion, that make great ſhew of Vertue and Piety: But foraſmuch as by this their Conduct they delude and hoodwink the People, it is but fitting to endeavour to prevent this ill effect, in defending the Truth. Shall we account the Rights of Truth the leſs certain, becauſe they have eſcaped the diſcerning of ſome honeſt and vertuous Men? Or the Deluſion the leſs dangerous, becauſe proceeding from thoſe that are ſuch? Let it be lawful for us then to bring back theſe Men from their Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings; and to convince them, that they ought no longer to defend Maxims, whoſe falſity is not more viſible, than it is prejudicial to the Intereſt of the Church and Community.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Concerning the Original of Sovereign Power.</head>
                     <p>WE may aſſert, That the Rights of Sovereignty, to ſpeak properly, have no Inſtitution in the Law of Nature. A Father indeed has his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in his power, and they are ſubject to him by a Natural Inſtitution, as well becauſe they have received their Life from him, which is the Foundation of all Good, as alſo for that they are beholden to him for their Education; which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55979:7"/> Life, no leſs precious than the former. But though this Power were not included within the narrow Bounds of each particular Family, and though we ſhould ſuppoſe it extended to the taking away of the Life of Rebellious Children, yet certain it is, that the Paternal Power is not unbounded, with reſpect to Time; for as ſoon as a Man is married, and begins to form another Family, this Act emancipates him from the Paternal Authority, as Jeſus Chriſt ſuppoſes, when he ſaid to the bleſſed Virgin, <hi>John</hi> 2.4. <hi>Is not my hour come yet?</hi> Which words <hi>Gregor Nyſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>n</hi> explains thus, <hi>An nondum venit mea hora, quae praebet aetati ut imperet, &amp; ſui ſit Juris?</hi> Is not my hour come yet, which allows my Age to command, and leaves me at my own diſpoſe? But the caſe is not the ſame with Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, whoſe Authority reacheth over a whole Society com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of ſeveral Families; for as they do not owe their Birth to the Magiſtrate, nor are obliged to him for their Education, as they are to their Parents, their Command cannot be founded on the Right of Nature, which ſubjects Children to their Parents.</p>
                     <p>Neither can we ſuppoſe that the Authority of Magiſtrates is bottom'd upon ſome Excellence they have by Nature above their Subjects. I own there be ſome Vertues and Talents which do ordinarily ſubmit the Spirits of ſuch as know them, to thoſe who are adorned therewith; and the higheſt degrees of Vertue and Wiſdom do naturally procure a veneration for thoſe that poſſeſs them. But who ſees not, that this is inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to be the foundation of Civil Power. A Magiſtrate is not always diſtinguiſhed by theſe illuſtrious Talents and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, which ſo powerfully attract Veneration in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. A Man may be very wiſe, and yet be ne'er the more obeyed by thoſe who don't underſtand the price of Wiſdom. He may be very valiant, but his Courage, being unaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Prudence, may render him contemptible in the Eyes of thoſe who apprehend his Temerity. It is plain then, that it is not this natural difference God hath put between Men, which is the ground of the Magiſtrates Authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Indeed, the ſame is the caſe of Magiſtracy, as of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, which entred into the World becauſe of Sin; for certainly, if Men in their behaviour liv'd up to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Law of Nature, one Man would never invade
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55979:7"/> what his Neighbour is poſſeſſed of, either by Inheritance, or by his own Induſtry: One Man would not defile the Bed of his Neighbour, or ſpill his Blood, to hinder the Oppoſition his Neighbour might make againſt his Enterpriſes. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Men are ſo prone to violate thoſe equitable Laws, to ſati fie their Paſſions, and corrupt Inclinations, therefore is the Magiſtrates Authority become neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>And how great ſoever we may conceive this Authority to be, yet we muſt acknowledge, that God never inſtituted it till after the Deluge, as appears from <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6. We read in the Scripture, that <hi>Cain,</hi> when he had kill'd his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> told God, That he feared that every one that met him, would kill him; but do not find, that he did in the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that his Father, as his Natural Sovereign, ſhould ſentence him for that Murther. This Impunity of <hi>Cain</hi> prov'd an encouragement to <hi>Lamech,</hi> as we ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.24. It ſeem'd indeed that the Authority of <hi>Adam,</hi> their common Father, together with that of the Patriarchs, might have been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to contain Men within the Bounds of their Duty, as well as the near Relation and Alliance that was between them. But this Paternal Authority, having by the ſpace of fifteen Ages been found incapab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e to reſtrain the licentiouſneſs of Men, and too weak to put a ſtop to their Debaucheries and Murthers, which at laſt drew down the Deluge upon them; we find that God afterwards inſtituted Magiſtracy, as a ſtronger Curb, to ſtop the impetuoſity of Mens exorbitant Paſſions. Moreover, Men being obliged to ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from one another, in order to their peopling of the whole Earth, conſequently could not obſerve the ſame Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Communion which linked them together under the Patriarchs; wherefore it was Natural to ſubſtitute to that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal Authority, a Government more accommodated to the ſtate of Men in their different and diſperſed Habitations. Wherefore, becauſe Men had learnt from the Example of thoſe who were drowned by the Flood, to make ſmall account of the remonſtrances of their Parents, as well as of the Divine Denunciations, God thought fit to lay a more ſtrong Curb in their Mouths, and to reſtrain them, by making temporal Death the Reward of thoſe who would not be contain'd within the Bounds of their Duty by the fear of Eternal
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55979:8"/> Sufferings, in theſe words, <hi>Whoſoever ſheddeth Man's Blood, by Man ſhall his Blood be ſhed.</hi> This being the ſenſe and full import of this Declaration, according as the Jews unanimouſly agree. Now this granted, it is evident, that ſince Soveraign Power was inſtituted by God for a Curb to ſin, we muſt ſuppoſe that there be Laws, which ſerve for a foundation of Society, and for the conſervation of which Soveraignty was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced at firſt: 'tis to make theſe Laws inviolable, and by puniſhments to reſtrain the unrulineſs and exhorbitance of the paſſions of Men, from tranſgreſſing of thoſe Laws, that the Sword at firſt was put into the Soveraign's Hand, and power given him to puniſh Criminals, or utterly to cut them off, as deſtructive to Society it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>From theſe two Principles, we very naturally deduce a third, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Character of a Soveraign, conſequently requires, That he who is clothed therewith, be one of the moſt perfect of the Society, that is one at the greateſt diſtance, from a diſpoſition to violate the Laws: for if he encourages others by his Example to violate them, and if by this means he ſubvert the foundations on which the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety ſubſiſts, directly croſſing the deſign and aim for which he was made a Soveraign; it is evident to a demonſtration, that he poſſeſſes the Soveraignty contrary to the intention of God, and the natural end of Society.</p>
                     <p>Nothing is more evident, than what I have here laid down; but it reſpects only the Society, conſidered with regard to thoſe of whom it conſiſts: for if we look upon it with reſpect to thoſe who are ſtrangers, and who may deſtroy it, by invading it by force of Arms, it appears clearly that the Soveraign, being the defender of Juſtice at home, finds himſelf natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally obliged, to protect the Society by Force; ſo that toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Juſtice, he ought alſo to be qualified with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Valiant, that he may oppoſe himſelf, with Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, to all Enemies from abroad, and hinder them from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the Society.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, the Character of <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſe</hi> is particularly required in a Soveraign, for neither Juſtice, nor Valour, are of any great uſe, as lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>g as they are ſeparate from Wiſdom and Prudence. Wiſdom is uſeful in Peace, and no leſs in time of War, is neceſſary with reſpect to Subjects as well as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55979:8"/> Enemies; ſhe ſhines forth in Treaties, as well as Ruptures; ſhe is of uſe in the proſecuting of injuries, as well as in the choice of means to obtain reparation; ſhe finds out Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients, againſt the greateſt difficulties; and, in a word, we may ſay that without her, the Political Government is as a Body without a Soul, and a Ship without a Pilot, or Helm, which is abandoned to the Winds to be toſſed at pleaſure, and which at laſt periſheth infallibly by daſhing it ſelf againſt the firſt Rock it meets with.</p>
                     <p>If we attentively heed what hath been here advanced, we ſhall find that this has ſerved as a common Principle, to all the different forms of Government, that have at any time obtained amongſt Men. Indeed it is not eaſie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, what form of Government God inſtituted by that Law, mentioned in the Ninth of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> whether he by thoſe words determined the Authority to one or more Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates; becauſe the word <hi>Man,</hi> is often taken collectively, to expreſs many; ſo that the words are too general to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide this queſtion: they conclude only that Murther is to be puniſhed with Death. From whence we infer that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate has power to puniſh Murtherers and other Criminals, that deſtroy the Laws, whereby the Society ſubſiſts. It is manifeſt therefore that by reaſon and experience Men came to prefer one kind of Government before another, and variouſly to divide the Authority amongſt many, according to the different acts to which it ought to be extended.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems that force was at firſt only made uſe of as a refuge for the weak, either to deſtroy the wild Beaſts, that devoured their Cattle, and ſome times Men too; or to put a ſtop to the injuſtice of thoſe, whoſe bodily ſtrength in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired them with deſigns to rob the weaker ſort of their poſſeſſions. And it is very probable, that foraſmuch, as ſoon after, they obſerved that the force which protected them, might as well oppreſs the Society, for whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and protection it was armed, they found that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy could not be lookt upon as an advantage, if it were not committed to the wiſe conduct of the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of the Society, who ſeem to have been the Judges, Magiſtrates and Counſellors of State, among all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that were ever inſtituted with any prudence. Thoſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55979:9"/> who conſidered the great parts that are neceſſary for the governing of a Society, preferred the way of chooſing their Governours. Thoſe who had experienced the ill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of corrupt Elections by Bribes or other ways, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the way of taking for their Governours, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of thoſe who had ruled them with Prudence. They who obſerved that one perſon is rarely capable of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and moderating ſo many different paſſions as may trouble a Society, thought good to divide the command amongſt many. Thoſe who took notice that this equality produced diſſenſions amongſt many Governors, placed the power in one perſon only. Thoſe that were aware that a ſingle perſon might overturn the Laws, and ſet up his will as the only rule of his conduct, found it neceſſary to preſerve to the People their ſhare in the Government. In a word, every Nation choſe that way they thought moſt ſure and proper to obtain the true ends of an happy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in order to ſecure and preſerve the Society.</p>
                     <p>What I have ſaid in general, concerning the original of Soveraignty or Magiſtracy amongſt Men, ſhews that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, but that the inſtitution thereof is Divine, though God did not think fit to determine it to any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain form of Magiſtracy, whether of Monarchy, Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſie or Democraſie, but left it to the Peoples free choice, to pitch upon that form they ſhould judge moſt convenient for them. But to procure a farther light to this matter, we muſt conſider the Judgment of Philoſophers and Divines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this point.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The different Opinions of Philoſophers and Divines concerning this matter.</head>
                     <p>IT may be ſaid, That there are three Opinions concerning the original of Soveraign Magiſtracy. <hi>Cicero,</hi> in his Books of the Commonwealth, was of Opinion, as appears from the definition he ſets down, That Governments were at firſt formed by an effect of pure neceſſity,<note place="margin">St. Auguſt. de civit. D.</note> which forced the weaker to ſeek for aid and ſuccour, from thoſe that were ſtronger, to ſecure themſelves from oppreſſion. This was alſo the Opinion of the famous Archbiſhop of <hi>Burgos</hi> in the Council of <hi>Baſil. Faſcic. Fol.</hi> 7.</p>
                     <p>The Body of Chriſtian Divines maintains that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Sword was inſtituted by God, as may be ſeen <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. And it appears that whereas before the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge the Patriarchs were the only Maſters of their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which gave occaſion to abundance of Crimes, Juſtice not being executed with vigour enough, to put a ſtop to the courſe of exorbitances: as long as it was in the hands of a common Father, God was pleaſed to enact a Law whereby the Sword ſhould no longer be bound up to each head of a Family, but committed to one who ſhould be particularly charged therewith by the common conſent of the Society.</p>
                     <p>The Third Opinion is that of ſome new Divines, and other flatterers of the unbridled power of Princes, who maintain that Kings derive their Authority immediately from God, and not mediately from the conſent of the People. Thus <hi>Peter de Marca</hi> declares himſelf on this point, <hi>de concord. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. following therein the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Victoria</hi> and <hi>Duval,</hi> the one a <hi>Spaniard</hi> and the other a <hi>Frenchman.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We need not wonder, if <hi>Cicero</hi> was miſtaken in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding of this matter, as being deſtitute of that light, which <hi>Moſes</hi> furniſheth Divines with. He determines this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55979:10"/> point only as a natural Philoſopher. However we muſt obſerve that <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf, and the moſt wiſe amongſt the Heathens, have ſufficiently given to underſtand, that they conceived Magiſtracy, without which it is impoſſible for a Society to ſubſiſt, to be of Divine Original, as well as all other good and profitable inſtitutions for the benefit of Mankind.</p>
                     <p>But not to inſiſt upon this, foraſmuch as all Divines agree that the original of Magiſtracy is from God, our buſineſs only is, to enquire, which is the truer Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, theirs who acknowledging the Divine inſtitution of Magiſtracy, maintain that this Authority is communicated to the Powers and Magiſtrates by the People, or of thoſe who pretend that God immediately communicates the ſame to the Magiſtrates that are inveſted therewith.</p>
                     <p>In order to the reſolving of which, before we paſs any further, we are to obſerve, 1ſt. That the Body of Divines who defend the former of theſe Opinions, do agree, That the Authority of Magiſtrates is not to be accounted leſs Divine, becauſe it does not immediately come down from God. They own theſe Two things. 1ſt. That God has ordered there ſhould be Sovereign Magiſtrates to regulate and govern Societies. 2ly. That God having diveſted private Perſons of the right of doing themſelves Juſtice, in caſe of Offences given them, has ordained that the Magiſtrates ſhould have the Sword put into their Hands, by Capital and other Puniſhments, to ſtop the violence of thoſe who diſturb the Peace of the Society, and violate the Rules of Juſtice. And in this reſpect they acknowledge Magiſtracy, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, a divine Settlement and Inſtitution.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are to obſerve, That when on the other hand they maintain, That the Power of the Magiſtrates is conferred by conſent of the People; in which reſpect they pretend, That St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls them <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that doth not in the leaſt diminiſh the Authority of this Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Magiſtrates, which they refer ſolely and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That whatſoever Notion we may frame of the Power of Magiſtrates, whether we ſuppoſe it conferr'd upon
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55979:10"/> them immediately by God, as <hi>M. de Marca</hi> pretends; or whether it be only mediately derived to them from God, by the intervening conſent of the People, the thing is ſtill the ſame; becauſe it is evident, that this Power is not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to them, but for the ſubſiſtence of the Society, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation whereof is the natural End of Government and Sovereignty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That they do not oppoſe this Notion of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Collation of the Sovereign Power by God, ſave only that they might expreſs themſelves more exactly, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the ordinary Governments of the World from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For the ſame Divines generally own, That the Inſtitution of the Royal Power in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was an immediate Act of God; but withal maintain, That the ſame cannot be ſaid of other Sovereigns.</p>
                     <p>This laid down, I ſay, That nothing can be imagined more vain, than the ſecond of theſe Opinions; and it is enough only to underſtand the terms which thoſe Divines make uſe of to expreſs their Sentiment, concerning the Original of Sovereign Magiſtrates in every State, and to conſider the Proofs they alledge, to evidence the falſeneſs of it; which Opinion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly I ſhall refute in the following Third Chapter.</p>

                     <p>I Say then, That it is falſe, That Sovereigns receive their Power immediately from God. This is a Truth may be eaſily made out. Indeed, though the Power of Magiſtrates, of what ſort ſoever they be, be of Divine Inſtitution; which of all the preſent Sovereign Powers, whether Monarchs, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, or any other Form of State, was inſtituted im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by God? And who are the Perſons inveſted therewith, whom God has immediately called to that ſort of Power? All States are formed either by Conqueſt, or by Conſent of the People; which intervenes in the Election at the firſt Founding of a State, and which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in every ſubſequent Election of Princes, or which is perpetuated in ſucceſſive Kingdoms. Was there any thing like to this in the advancement of <hi>David</hi> to the Royal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Is it not viſible, that in order to an immediate Eſtabliſhment from God, there is required an expreſs Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſuch as may be equivalent, at leaſt to a publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his Will, in favour of him whom he will ſet on the Throne? Thus things were carried with reſpect both to <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> and who will affirm there is any King now in the World that has attain'd the Regal Power after this manner? If there be any, let them acquaint us with his Name, and the manner of God's revealing himſelf to the People, to make them know, that he immediately made choice of ſuch a Perſon to ſupply that Place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Who ſees not, that the whole Diſcourſe of theſe Divines is nothing but a continual Equivocation? An Office is inſtituted immediately by God; wherefore all that are called by ordinary ways and methods, are immediately eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in it by God. I had as lief they ſhould tell me, That becauſe Marriage derives its firſt inſtitution and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55979:11"/> from God in the Perſon of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> whom God joyned to <hi>Adam,</hi> That therefore all Marriages are made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by God, and that he is the immediate Author of them. The one is every whit as reaſonable as the other, and in the mean time the ſecond is abſolutely falſe. The Author of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.16. That the Art of Tilling the Ground was created by God: Doth it follow from thence, that God hath immediately ſetled ſuch and ſuch a one in the Calling of Husbandry.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If all Sovereign Magiſtrates deſire their Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion immediately from God, how is it that we find ſo great a diverſity in the Form of theſe Sovereign Governments. In ſome States we find Kings, in others Ariſtocraſies or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocraſies: Doth not this variety make it evident, that though God indeed have inſtituted Magiſtracy in general, yet he hath left it to the People to determin the Form of it, according to their Need, their Inclinations, and the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances wherein they find themſelves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Doth it not moſt evidently appear, That if the Perſon were immediately inſtituted by God, it would be great folly for any Society to trouble themſelves about enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Laws for a Free Election at every Change, or to eſtabliſh it by way of Succeſſion in Monarchies? If God eſtabliſheth all Sovereign Magiſtrates immediately, to what purpoſe are all thoſe Rules and Limitations, which by their variety afford us a ſufficient demonſtration, that this Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not an immediate effect of the Deity.</p>
                     <p>The Philoſophers were fully of this Opinion, as we may ſee in the Books of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Policy; where he makes out, That the cauſe of the various ſorts of Governments that are in the World, is nothing elſe but the different Judgments of the People, concerning the ſeveral ſorts and manners of Government: Some of which have choſen one Form, to avoid the Inconveniencies they foreſaw and apprehended from another; and others again being induced to embrace that Form, by the advantages they diſcerned in it, rather than another. This is a matter we ought to mind very carefully, that we may not put a ridiculous ſenſe upon ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the Antients when they ſpeak of Magiſtracy, as founded in the Law of Nature.</p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:55979:12"/>
                     <p>The Lawyers agree with the Philoſophers in this Point. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian</hi> and <hi>Juſtinian</hi> both of them tell us, That the People of <hi>Rome</hi> beſtowed upon the Emperor <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> by the Royal Law, all the Right and Empire by which they were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected unto that Emperor, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ff de Conſtit. Princip. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> explains what properly a Prince is, in theſe terms; <hi>A Prince</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is a Perſon who has received from the People the Power of Commanding and Ruling over them, §.</hi> 6. de Jure Natur. &amp; Gent.</p>
                     <p>The Canoniſts of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are no leſs expreſs in this Matter, than the Philoſophers and Lawyers. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Bertrandi</hi> lays it down for his Foundation, in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Power, <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum,</hi> which was copied by an Engliſh Monk, and is found among the Manuſcripts.</p>
                     <p>The Divines of that Communion make a Principle of it, as appears by the Diſcourſe of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Burgos,</hi> which I have before cited. And <hi>Soto</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Juſt. &amp; Jure, Regalem poteſtatem, Populi naturali lumine erexerunt,</hi> That the People, by the Light of Nature eſtabliſhed Kingly Power</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M. de Marca</hi> owns, That the Canoniſts of his School do not favour his Opinion; but withal maintains, That they have fallen upon the Opinion contrary to his, that they might make a greater difference between the Civil and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Power, than there is indeed; and to depreſs the Civil Power below the Eccleſiaſtical. He might alſo have alledged againſt the Divines of his School, That in this Queſtion they relied too much on the Judgment of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who was their St. <hi>Paul,</hi> until the times of the Reformation. However, that which <hi>M. de Marca</hi> declares as his Judgment concerning this Matter, is too generally ſpoken: For we ſee <hi>Marſilius</hi> of <hi>Padoua</hi> following the ſame Principles, in his <hi>Defenſorium Pacis,</hi> though he undertook the Defence of the Emperor <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> againſt the Enterpriſes of the Pope; but however he pretends, That the Scripture and Antiquity furniſh us with quite other Notions about this Matter; which we ſhall next make it our buſineſs to enquire into.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> An Examination of the Arguments which are alledged for the Proof of this Opinion.</head>
                     <p>HE alledges only two places of Scripture, the one is that of St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13. and the other is taken from the Sixth Chapter of the <hi>Wiſdom of Solomon,</hi> which is an Apocryphal Book; but neither the one nor the other proves the thing he pretends.</p>
                     <p>It appears by the former of theſe Texts, That the Apoſtle endeavours to oppoſe the Opinion of thoſe among the Jews, who pretended, That becauſe the Monarchies or States of the Heathens had not an immediate Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God, as that of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to which God had in a particular manner ſubjected the Jews, that therefore they were not obliged to ſubmit themſelves to the Authority of Heathen Magiſtrates. Wherefore he points them from that immediate Inſtitution made in favour of the Kings of <hi>Judea,</hi> to that common and more ancient Inſtitution of Magiſtracy among the Poſterity of <hi>Noah,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſets down, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. as being ſufficient to make the Authority of Magiſtrates reſpected, whatſoever Nation or Religion they might be of; whether they deriv'd their Power from the Conſent of the People, or whether they had obtained it, by Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the lawful Sovereigns of their Authority, as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> had done, with reſpect to the Kings of <hi>Judea.</hi> In a word, the Apoſtle in that place intends nothing elſe but to authorize the Maxim of the <hi>Eſſenians,</hi> as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by <hi>Joſephus, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Bello Jud. cap.</hi> 12. <hi>Fidem omnibus ſervare, maxime verò principibus,</hi>

                        </gap>, to be faithful and true to all Men, but more eſpecially to Princes; becauſe the Sovereign Command never befel any one without the Divine Providence. Theſe <hi>Eſſenians</hi> maintained againſt the Sect of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55979:13"/> they might lawfully ſubmit themſelves to a Heathen Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, without always foſtering a Spirit of Rebellion againſt him, and without diſputing or queſtioning his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, under pretext that the Jewiſh Government had been eſtabliſhed immediately by God. But doth this Text of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the leaſt prove, that every Pagan Prince was immediately ſet upon the Throne by God?</p>
                     <p>The Paſſage quoted from the Sixth Chapter of the <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Solomon,</hi> is nothing at all to their purpoſe; becauſe the Author of that Book addreſſes himſelf, in all appearance, to the Kings of <hi>Judea,</hi> who, as all agree, deriv'd their Acceſſion to the Throne immediately from God; ſo that it might well be ſaid to them, <hi>Power is given you of the Lord, and Sovereignty from the Higheſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>True it is, That Jeſus Chriſt expreſſeth himſelf in words much to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>John</hi> 19. ſpeaking to <hi>Pilate</hi> the Governor of <hi>Judea; Thou couldeſt have no power at all againſt me, except it were given thee from above.</hi> But it is viſible that he ſpeaks this only with reſpect to the Order of the Divine Providence, which had ſuffered the Throne of <hi>Judea</hi> to be overthrown by the <hi>Romans;</hi> ſo that inſtead of her Natural Magiſtrates, ſhe was now ſubject to Strangers. The Empire of <hi>Nimrod</hi> was founded in the ſame manner with that of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and yet I ſcarce think any Man will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that God committed the Sovereign Power to him, in the ſame manner that he did vouchſafe it to <hi>David.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>True it is, That the Scripture gives <hi>Cyrus</hi> the K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ng of <hi>Perſia</hi> the Title of the <hi>Lord's Anointed;</hi> which ſeems to import, as if God had in an immediate manner raiſed him to the Throne like <hi>David:</hi> But this is no due conſequence; for the Notion of the <hi>Lord's Anointed,</hi> ſignifies only his particular Deſtination of him, to be the Inſtrument of the <hi>Jews</hi> deliverance from their Captivity. I freely own, That a Divine Providence may ordinarily be obſerved in the Elevation of Kings; and that the ſame may be taken notice of, as intervening in a more eſpecial manner, in the raiſing of thoſe Kings whom God deſigns to make uſe of for the good of his Church, which is linked with the Civil Society: But I do not conceive that from thence it will follow, either that the acts of ordinary Providence,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55979:13"/> manifeſting themſelves upon occaſions, are ſufficient to make an immediate divine Inſtitution of Princes, no more than other Events, wherein Providence intervenes, can properly be called <hi>immediate</hi> Effects of the Deity; nor that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Acts of Divine Providence, as were thoſe that reſpected <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ought to be alledged as an Argument in common Events.</p>
                     <p>The words we find in the Eighth Chapter of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> are alſo commonly quoted to this purpoſe, <hi>By me Kings Reign, and Princes decree Juſtice;</hi> but it is manifeſt, that this is ſaid with regard to Wiſdom, of which he was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, and which diſplays it ſelf in the management of Humane Affairs, without intimating any immediate Act of the Deity.</p>
                     <p>Moreover we are carefully to obſerve, That though the Scriptures attribute to God the Inſtitution of Magiſtrates, in which reſpect alſo they call them a Divine Inſtitution, and aſcribe to God the Exaltation of Princes in particular; yet they never expreſs themſelves but in a very general manner, as when they ſet forth to us the part God bears in all Events. Thus God is ſaid to overturn Thrones, in like manner as he is ſaid to erect them; he is ſaid to ſettle Tyrants, as well as the moſt lawful Kings: All which Expreſſions relating to his Providence, which does or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits things by the intervening miniſtry of Second Cauſes, can have no influence upon the Judgments we are to make concerning the Authority of Princes, with regard to their Divine inſtitution.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M. de Marca</hi> makes uſe of ſome Paſſages out of the Fathers, to confirm his Opinion. But, Firſt, they infer nothing but what we are ready to grant, <hi>viz.</hi> That God having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Magiſtracy, thoſe who are inveſted therewith, ought to be conſidered, as the Miniſters of God; which is ſufficient for a foundation of their Authority, without any neceſſity of ſuppoſing, that God immediately endows every King with the Royal Power, wherewith he is inveſted. This is the Opinion of <hi>Theophilus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch, ad Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol. Lib.</hi> 1. where he ſaith, That the Prince has received in ſome ſort from God the adminiſtration of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55979:14"/> mediate inſtitution, but doth not at all expreſs an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate inſtitution, as <hi>M. de Marca</hi> conceives. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, They diſtinctly lay down, That Magiſtracy is a humane inſtitution, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> qualifies it, becauſe all Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and Kings themſelves are ordained, and eſtabliſhed by Men; as <hi>Oecumenius</hi> explains that place, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſays no more, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>contr. Haer. C.</hi> 24. He refutes the Opinion of the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> who would have Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates to be an inſtitution of the Devil, and he makes it appear, that both the Old and New Teſtament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, That Magiſtrates are one of the means which Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has judged neceſſary to put a ſtop to the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Wickedneſs and Crimes, which had deluged the Heathen World, whom the fear of God alone was not able to keep within the bounds of Juſtice. To which purpoſe he ſaith, <hi>Cujus juſſu homines naſcuntur, hujus juſſu &amp; Reges inſtituuntur;</hi> by whoſe command Men are born, by his command Kings are ordained. Neither doth <hi>Epiphanius</hi> advance any thing more than this. <hi>Haereſi</hi> 40. <hi>contra Archontic.</hi>

Multi namque munere Divino, multi etiam Dei permiſſa regnant. Wherefore whoſoever temporally rules over other Men, ought to think his Kingdom committed to him, not by Men but by God. For many do reign by a Divine Grant, and many only by Divine Permiſſion.</hi> Which words were uſed by them, only as a motive, to oblige that Emperour, not to look upon the Royal Dignity as an Inheritance or Poſſeſſion, but as a charge or office inſtituted by God, of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration whereof he was to give an account to God. <hi>Concil.

                     <p>I know it has been cuſtomary for Emperors and Kings, to look upon themſelves as choſen of God, Crowned of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which hath given occaſion to ſome Painters and Gravers to repreſent them, as receiving their Crowns from Heaven. I am not ignorant alſo that the Emperour <hi>Lewis,</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> maintains, That the Imperial Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, is immediately from God, and not from the Pope; but his firſt expreſſion reſpects only the order of Providence, and the ſecond the Pope's pretenſions, who maintained, That Emperors held the Empire as a Fief, whereof the Pope was the Lord Paramount.</p>
                     <p>After all, though theſe Gentlemen, who attribute to every Soveraign Magiſtrate and to every King, the power which they enjoy, as immediately conferred upon them by God, think by this means to lay a more ſure foundation for the veneration which the People owe to the Royal Power, it is very evident that they advance little by this their Opinion, if it be true, that this power, though we ſhould ſuppoſe it granted immediately by God, muſt be limited by certain Laws, and that the People have right to impoſe them upon them, when they elevate them to that Dignity.</p>

                     <p>IT is commonly conceived that there are two ſorts of Government, the one Abſolute, and the other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited: Abſolute Government is ſuppoſed to be that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Governor doth ſo abſolutely enjoy all the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity neceſſary for the ſubſiſtence of the Society, that none ſhare with him in it, ſo that he exerciſeth it according to his good pleaſure. In ſuch a Government as this, the Prince can make Laws, and again revoke, or diſpence with them. He can ſettle inferiour Magiſtrates, and diſcharge or remove them again at pleaſure, and repeal their Acts or Decrees. He can declare War to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the State, and make Peace with them. He can ſave the Lives of Criminals, or take them away: all which he may do without any one having any right to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict or oppoſe him. Neither is there any thing contrary to the nature of Government, in this Abſolute Power: for ſince it is neceſſary to make Laws for the good of the State, according as there is need, to nominate Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and to remove them; to examine the Judgments of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Courts, and repeal them, if they be unjuſt: it is a thing indifferent to the State, by whom theſe things are done, ſo they be but done in ſuch a manner, as to anſwer the natural end of Government, which is the good of the Society.</p>
                     <p>But we muſt take heed of conceiving any ſuch Abſolute Power inherent in any Sovereigns whatſoever, whereby they may lawfully fruſtrate and overthrow the ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For how abſolute ſo ever a P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55979:16"/> founded on the Right of Nations. Thirdly, He is obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the fundamental Laws of the State, which he governs. Fourthly, he lies under an obligation of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Laws of the Government, committed to his charge, ſo far as to endeavour to obtain the ends thereof, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the happineſs of the Society.</p>
                     <p>But if any Man conceives a Government abſolute in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, and whereof the Sovereigns are not bou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

For ſeeing that Tyranny is diametrically oppoſite to the natural end and aim of Government, I do not ſee how it can be ranked with lawful Governments, there being as much abſurdity in ſuppoſing it ſuch, as to ſuppoſe an unjuſt and impoſſible Law, to be a good and true Law, becauſe publiſhed by one, who has the Authority to do it.</p>
                     <p>I cannot find that ever there was any Empire or Authority Abſolute in all reſpects, as is pretended. Thoſe very So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns which are conceived to be reſolute to this degree, as thoſe of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> had notwithſtanding ſome irrevocable and inviolable Laws, which were funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to that State; as appears from the Book of <hi>Daniel, Ariſtotle</hi> ſeems to ſpeak of theſe ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="3 letters">

And I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much queſtion, whether any ſuch example can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, no not in the Empire of the Turks, which has been always lookt upon as the moſt Abſolute and Deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Government, where the Sover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>igns have attributed to themſelves ſo vaſt and unbounded a Power, and actually enjoy'd the ſame.</p>
                     <p>I know it is commonly apprehended, that Conquerors, ſuch as <hi>Nimrod,</hi> and many others, did in ſo abſolute a manner poſſeſs themſelves of all the Rights of Sovereignty, that there was nothing left to their Subj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cts of what Rank or Order ſoever. But to declare my ſenſe of this matter, we are to obſerve, Firſt, That Conquerors had no other aim, but to rob other Sovereigns of their Power, without changing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55979:16"/> any thing in the Government of the State they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded. Secondly, That thoſe Invaſions having no other foundation, but a Conqueſt by force of Arms and Violence, contrary to the Law of Nature, which made <hi>Seneca</hi> call this ſort of Conquerors <hi>Magnos &amp; furioſos Latrones,</hi> great and furious Robbers; theſe Conquerors eaſily perceived, it was neceſſary for them, to trim and rectifie this their unjuſt Power, if they would have their Authority to be laſting: whereupon they accordingly took care to moderate it, by Conventions and Laws, to the Juſtice of which the People gave their conſent. Thirdly, That theſe Conventions and theſe Laws, were to ſpeak truly and properly, the lawful Title of all the Authority their Subjects owned in them. Fourthly, That this conſent of the Subjects, always ſuppoſeth, that the ends of Government be preſerved, except we ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade our ſelves, that there be Subjects Fools enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to a Government, whoſe aim ſhould not be levelled at their Advantage and Proſperity.</p>
                     <p>'Tis horribly to delude ones ſelf, to found the Idea of an Abſolute Government in all reſpects, amongſt Men, upon a notion of the abſolute Empire God has over all his Creatures: for is it not evident that this Divine Empire, ſuppoſeth an immoveable Juſtice, and infinite wiſdom, and a moſt tender love for his Creatures, which are the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Attributes of God, and which cannot be found in any mortal Man? But ſome, it may be, will tell me, That I contradict the Stile of Holy Scripture, in denying that Tyrants can lawfully enjoy ſo abſolute a Power, when the Prophets tell us, concerning ſome Kings, That God gave them ſuch abſolute Power: as we find it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in particular concerning <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Dan.</hi> 5.18, 19. But the anſwer to this Objection is obvious, Firſt, That which ought to be referred to God's Permiſſion only, is not to be attributed to a conceſſion of the Deity, which latter is only ſufficient to eſtabliſh a lawful Right; for otherwiſe, we muſt ſay, That God had given a juſt right to the falſe Prophets to deceive <hi>Ahab,</hi> by their lying Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. If this be not the caſe, let any Man anſwer me theſe Two Queſtions, Firſt, Whether <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in uſing this abſolute Power, which he had, without
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55979:17"/> any conſent or concurrence of his Subjects, in killing them without cauſe, and contrary to the Laws of Juſtice and Equity? Secondly, Whether God could juſtly puniſh <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,</hi> as he did, for making uſe of this Tyrannical Power, which he had ſuffered him to invade. <hi>Nemini injuriam facit qui jure ſuo utitur.</hi> He that makes uſe of his own Right injures no body, is a Maxim of Law.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Otherwiſe we ſhould be fain to ſuppoſe, That thoſe, who at any times have raiſed themſelves againſt Tyrants, had been great Criminals, whereas the Holy Scripture doth ſet them forth for Heroes, ſuch as <hi>Ehud,</hi> who have undertaken to rid the World of their unjuſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, by killing them.</p>
                     <p>Poſſibly it may be further objected to me, That by theſe aſſertions I oppoſe the Doctrine of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which equally command all both Jews and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to ſubmit themſelves to the Powers that had conquered them, and particularly to the Power of the Romans, who pretended to be abſolute over all their Subjects. But it will be found that there is nothing at all of any contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction between that which I maintain, and what is here objected. The Jews being conquered by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> were become the Slaves of that Monarch, and owed him all manner of obedience, which <hi>Bondmen</hi> do to him who has ſaved their Lives, when it was in his power to kill them. And for the reſt, the Scripture does not determine, whether the Tyrannical power they attributed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, be lawful or no. Sure it is, that an unlawful and Tyrannical Sovereign may rule legally in ſeveral reſpects, in which caſe, it imports little, to thoſe who are ſubject to it, contrary to their wills, whether the Power, under which they are, be lawful in all reſpects or not.</p>
                     <p>Let this therefore be laid down for a certain truth, That every lawful power is neceſſarily limited by Laws, That theſe Laws are the foundation of the Government; from which the Sovereigns cannot depart, without over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the Society, for the ſubſiſtence of which, the Political Government was at firſt inſtituted by God.</p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:55979:17"/>
                     <p>But this is not the only kind of limitation, which may be obſerved in the Powers that govern Societies. As God has not preſcribed any ſort of Government, in preference to others, the Wiſdom of Men have diverſly limited the way and conſtitution thereof. Moſt People finding by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, That Monarchy, though it have many advantages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore other Governments, is apt to degenerate to Arbitrary Power, thought it fitting that the greateſt Lords of the Community, ſhould concur with the King in the exerciſe of his Authority: others again were of Opinion, That the People ought to have the chiefeſt ſhare in the Government, foraſmuch as the main end of the Government is to make them happy. Theſe different apprehenſions of Men, have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the ſeveral forms of Government, the aim of thoſe, who contrived thoſe different forms, being only to prevent oppreſſion and injuſtice, which directly croſs the end of Government.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Concerning the Extent of the Power of Sovereigns.</head>
                     <p>WHat I have here ſet down concerning the Nature of Governments, the moſt Abſolute of which are not unbounded by the Laws of God, by the Laws which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the Right of Nations, by the fundamental Laws of the State, and more particularly by Bounds preſcribed to the Authority of Sovereigns: ſufficiently ſhews what is the juſt extent of Sovereign Power, and how far Men are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to yield Obedience to it. Indeed, foraſmuch as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Obedience are relative terms, which recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally eſtabliſh or overthrow one another, it is eaſie to judge, That Obedience cannot be due to Authority, but in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the extent of the Authority.</p>
                     <p>Paternal Authority, in the manner as God had eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed it under the Law, could not inflict Death upon a Son, but in the preſence of the Judges, and upon the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Witneſſes. The Authority of a Judge cannot be diſcharged, but in the due Forms of Judicature, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Laws; he cannot puniſh a Criminal extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciouſly, notwithſtanding he might have abſolute know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Offence.</p>
                     <p>This laid down, and there is nothing more evident, it will be eaſie to determin, how far the Obedience of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects is engaged in the various ſorts of Government under which they reſort.</p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:55979:18"/>
                     <p>As to thoſe Governments or Powers, which have no other Law but their own Will, whether at firſt they were raiſed by way of Conqueſt, which ſeems to reduce Subjects to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Slaves; or whether from lawful Governments they have by degrees degenerated into Tyranny by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of Sovereigns, we ought naturally to diſtinguiſh between the uſe theſe Powers make of their Authority; and their abuſing of it, by rendring their Authority unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and extending it beyond its juſt limits. The Captain of a company of High-way-men, that is a Father, may exact of his Son the Obedience which a Child owes his Father; but his quality of Captain of High-way-men, does not give him any right to command his Son to rob or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And ſo far is the Son from being obliged to obey ſuch kind of Commands, that he becomes Criminal by obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
                     <p>It is evident then, That in theſe ſorts of Governments, as long as the Prince enacts Laws conformable to the fundamental Laws of the State, and that he behaves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a Father of his Country, there lies a neceſſity upon the People of obeying him; and this neceſſity is founded upon their Relation to the Authority, which is juſt and legal, with reſpect to its Function and Exerciſe.</p>
                     <p>But we muſt judge otherwiſe, when the Queſtion is of unjuſt Laws which the Power enacts for the Oppreſſion of his Subjects: For then there ſeems no further neceſſity of obeying, to lye upon the Subjects, than what reſults from a deſire of avoiding their own deſtruction, which depends on the Pleaſure of the Power that oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them, which cannot ſettle a lawful Right on Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, other than ſuch as a Maſter may have over his Slave or Bondman, according to the Laws of Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
                     <p>And as to Governments which are bounded by fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Laws, it is apparent, That the Powers having no Authority at all, but according to the Laws whereby they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55979:19"/> are eſtabliſhed, their Subjects are ſet free from obeying them, as ſoon as they tranſgreſs thoſe Laws. If a King, who has no Power to make Laws, will of his alone Authority under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to publiſh any, without the concurrence of thoſe who ſhare with him in the Legiſlative Power, none of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are obliged to obey him. If a King, who has no right to lay any Taxes on his People, undertake to charge them with Impoſitions, the People are not obliged to pay ought of them. If the King, who has no Power to declare War, doth do it without conſent of the State, the People are not obliged to go to War.</p>
                     <p>Nothing is more viſible, than that Obedience may yet more juſtly be refuſed, when Sovereigns undertake to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the State, in diſpenſing with all the Laws, and in attempting to rule by an Arbitrary Power: whereas the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Laws of the State, which are the Bond of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, do only allow them a limited Power.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto our New Divines agree with others, That Subjects are diſpenſed with from giving Obedience to an Illegal Power. But foraſmuch as a State muſt neceſſarily periſh, when ſubject to a Power that is reſolved to overthrow all; the Queſtion is, What may be expedient and lawful for People to do in this caſe?</p>
                     <p>There are but Two means imaginable to remedy ſo urging an Extremity: The one is to reſiſt the Power that abuſeth his Authority, thereby to oblige him, for time to come, to keep himſelf within the Bounds that are ſet him.</p>
                     <p>The other is to reject him altogether, and to rid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of him, when there appears no probability of reducing him to the terms of Juſtice, and to the Rules of his Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>'Tis againſt theſe Two Articles our New Divines op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves might and main. They conceive on
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55979:19"/> the one hand, that though the People be not bound to obey unjuſt Commands, yet they never can have any Right to reſiſt the Sovereign Power; no, not when they make uſe of Violence, to oblige the People to execute their wicked Deſigns. This is the Doctrine of <hi>Non-reſiſtance</hi> or <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> which has been ſo much agitated of late years.</p>
                     <p>And as to the other Article, they maintain the People have yet leſs right to caſt off their Princes, or rid themſelves of them, how high ſoever the Abuſes may be they commit, in exceeding the bounds of their Authority, and how Tyrannical or Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſoever their Government may be: That Sovereign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers depend on none but God, ſo that the People cannot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out invading the Rights of the Deity, undertake to depoſe or puniſh them.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the Points we are to conſider at preſent. I begin with <hi>Non-Rreſiſtance,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Paſſive-Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Concerning Non-reſiſtance.</head>
                     <p>THis Doctrine of <hi>Non-reſiſtance,</hi> ſeems to me to be founded upon Three Suppoſitions, which may be eaſily convinc'd of Falſity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Theſe Gentlemen forge to themſelves an <hi>Idea</hi> of Sovereign Powers, and aſcribe certain Rights to them, which they afterwards look upon as Eſſential to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and conſequently as Rights inſeparable from Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, whatſoever ſort of Sovereignty it may be. Which Eſſential Rights, according to their account, are theſe: <hi>Firſt,</hi> Not to be accountable to any but God. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To have the whole diſpoſal of the Sword. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To be exempt from all Coercive Power whatſoever. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Not to be liable to ſuffer Reſiſtance, on any pretext. <hi>Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> to be inveſted with the Legiſlative Power. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that without theſe Rights a Prince is ſtill but a Subject; and conſequently, that they are all Eſſential to Sovereign Power, and therefore inſeparable from it. Upon theſe Premiſes they with eaſe eſtabliſh this Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, That foraſmuch as the Right of not being liable to Reſiſtance, is inſeparably annexed to Sovereignty, the People can never of Right reſiſt their Princes on any pretext what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
                     <p>If we object againſt this their Scheme, That the Rights they attribute to Sovereignty, are ſuch as cannot agree with a Sovereignty limited by Laws, which allow of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, becauſe there can be no Authority but by Law, and according to Law: Whence it follows, That it is lawful to Reſiſt him who has no Authority.</p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:55979:20"/>
                     <p>They ſuppoſe in the <hi>Second</hi> place, That all Limitations whatſoever, do only reſpect the Exerciſe of the Sovereign Power, without being able in the leaſt to derogate from the Eſſentials of Sovereignty; and that after all, theſe Limitations are only the Effects of the conſent of Sovereigns; which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding only from their good will, are revocable, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> as ſoon as it pleaſeth them ſo to do.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Suppoſition is this: They pretend that the Holy Scripture holds to us ſuch a Power inherent in Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns, as can never be lawfully reſiſted; and that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts People to ſubmit themſelves ſo abſolutely to it, that they never undertake to oppoſe themſelves againſt its unlawful Effects otherwiſe than by Patience, when they are convinced in Conſcience, of the Injuſtice of the Laws and Commands enjoyned.</p>
                     <p>'Tis an eaſie matter to overthrow the <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> I would fain know who has given theſe Gentlemen the Power of determining, as they do, what is Eſſential to Sovereignty. Do they derive theſe their Notions from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, or from Reaſon, which is common to all Men? If they ſay they derive the definition they give us of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty from Revelation, they will do well to point us to the places of Scripture where this Notion is ſet down.</p>
                     <p>If they draw it from Reaſon, then I cannot but wonder that ſo many Stateſmen and Writers of Civil Matters have fail'd of ſtumbling on the ſame Notion; and it ſeems to me an inextricable thing, that ſo many Nations ſhould agree to reject what they approve, and to approve what they reject.</p>
                     <p>To ſay here, That they draw this definition from the <hi>Idea</hi> of Sovereignty, which loſeth its nature when diveſted of theſe Characters, ſhews they are willing either to abuſe themſelves or others by a pitiful Equivocation. The word <hi>Sovereign</hi> imports a relation to Inferiors; and as the relation has a certain foundation, ſo it is likewiſe evident, that it hath its bounds ſet proportionable to its foundation.
<pb facs="tcp:55979:21"/> Where there is no Authority, neither is there any founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Obedience: Now there is no Authority but in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the Laws which eſtabliſh the Authority; wherefore it inconteſtably follows, There can be no Authority where the Law is ſo far from allowing any, that it oppoſes it.</p>
                     <p>It will never ceaſe to be true, That the Authority is Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, though it be not ſo in all reſpects. The Conſuls of <hi>Rome</hi> were Sovereign Magiſtrates, though the People had Power to oppoſe themſelves againſt their Authority, when they abuſed the Power they were intruſted with, for the good of the Commonwealth. In <hi>France</hi> they give their Parliaments the Name of <hi>Sovereign Courts,</hi> though their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence be not always irrevocable.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Suppoſition is only founded upon this Notion, That Conquerors having invaded the Liberty and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the People, were afterwards ſo kind, to reſtore ſome part thereof to them again by their Conceſſions; but that theſe <hi>Acts of Grace</hi> do not at all diveſt them of the Right of Acting whenever it ſhall pleaſe them, as if their Power was altogether Unlimited and Arbitrary. This Notion is much the ſame with that of the Partiſans of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> who maintain, That the Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church are only Acts of Grace and Favour granted to that Church; whereas the <hi>French</hi> pretend, That they are common Rights and Franchiſes which their Anceſtors have conſtantly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, according to what <hi>P. Pithou</hi> declares concerning them.</p>
                     <p>But indeed, to ſpeak truly, this Suppoſition cannot be admitted with reſpect to conquered States, at leaſt for the moſt part. Ordinarily a Conqueſt is made upon the Power that governs the State; ſo that the State only changes its Maſter, the fundamental Laws of the Land receiving no Alteration from this Change. Of this we have an Inſtance in <hi>England,</hi> when King <hi>William</hi> conquered it, who at his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſware to keep the Laws of St. <hi>Edward;</hi> and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors were fain to ſwear the ſame. Now one of theſe Laws (<hi>c.</hi> 15. <hi>T.</hi> 1. <hi>Spelm. p.</hi> 622.) imports, That a Prince that abuſeth the Power he is intruſted with, does loſe the Title of King: From whence it follows, That his Subjects
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55979:21" rendition="simple:additions"/> need not own or obey him, and that conſequently it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to reſiſt him.</p>
                     <p>To maintain, That a King, whoſe Power is limited by the fundamental Laws of a State, and which he is inveſted with upon that condition, when at his Coronation he ſwears to the People, is indeed obliged to keep the ſaid Oath, for fear of God; but that he is not at all engaged by this his Oath to the People, is rather a piece of Raillery, than Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. What, Does not the Oath the People ſwear to the King oblige them in Allegiance to him? and how can we then ſuppoſe that the reciprocal Oath of the King ſhould not as well oblige him to his People? Surely, if we well weigh the caſe, 'tis impoſſible but we muſt diſcern a palpable falſity in this Opinion of <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> in the way theſe Gentlemen propoſe it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> They grant a Right unto Sovereignty which is dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically oppoſite to the end of Sovereignty, according to the Divine Deſtination. For the good of the Society, and its Subſiſtence, was God's End in inſticuting of the Sovereign Power; whereas by their Hypotheſis the Sovereignty may become an inſtrument of the utter ruin of the Society, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it ſhall pleaſe the Sovereign; his Subjects in the mean time having no means to attain the ſaid End, or being in any condition to hinder their being deprived of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> They ſuppoſe, That God in allowing a lawful Right to Sovereigns, has ſubjected the People to a neceſſity of groaning under an Illegal Right, and which God has never beſtowed upon them; and for the Uſurpation of which he will condemn thoſe who do arrogate the ſame to themſelves; which is much to the ſame purpoſe, as if I ſhould ſay, That becauſe God has eſtabliſhed Judges, he has thereby obliged the People to ſuffer Robbery, when the Judges ſhall think fit to turn Robbers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They make the condition of a Civil Society more unhappy, than was the condition of Families in the ſtate of Nature, before Societies were formed. For the liberty of defending one's ſelf is permitted to every one by Nature;
<pb facs="tcp:55979:22"/> but after the Society is once formed, it would follow, That the whole Society would be obliged, by a Principle of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to ſuffer their Throats to be cut by a Prince of the humour of a <hi>Nero</hi> or a <hi>Caligula.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They turn to meer Chymera's and Viſions, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the wiſdom of Men have been able to find out to make States happy, by ſecuring them againſt Tyranny. I ſpeak of Laws and Oaths; the Laws are the bands and cement of the Society, and the foundation, as well as the meaſure of the Obedience we owe to Princes. The Oaths are the Seal of the Contract, by which the Subjects are obliged to obey them, upon condition that they govern according to Law. But all this is to no purpoſe, and is of no uſe to the People, as ſoon as the Tyrant thinks fit to overturn the Laws, and to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Foraſmuch as the <hi>Third</hi> Suppoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture maintains <hi>Non-reſiſtance,</hi> with regard to Sovereigns, whether they act according to or againſt Law, is of greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, it will be convenient to examine the ſame more heedfully; and the rather becauſe Men of Abilities and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have endeavoured ſtrongly to aſſert it, and to make it paſs current with others, and that with all their might.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>FOraſmuch as the Doctrine of <hi>Non-reſiſtance</hi> directly thwarts a natural Principle, to wit, that of our own preſervation, and that of the Society whereof we are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; we may eaſily judge, That in caſe the Scripture does aſſert it, we muſt ſuppoſe it has done it, with all poſſible clearneſs and diſtinction; but we do not find any ſuch thing.</p>
                     <p>I find but one place in the Old Teſtament, which can be wreſted to this purpoſe with any probability; 'tis the Deſcription of the behaviour of a King, ſet down 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. &amp; 10. where the vulgar Tranſlation interprets <hi>Miſpath,</hi> by the Word <hi>Right, hoc eſt Jus Regis.</hi> But I am aſtoniſhed how any could be miſtaken in this caſe. For Firſt, It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that God in that place gives us the Deſcription of a Tyrant, and not of a King: for indeed we find nothing like to it in the Deſcription he gives us of a King by <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 17. Which appears to be ſo, becauſe <hi>Samuel</hi> held forth this Looking-glaſs to them, to make them quit their demand of having a King ſet over them, as the reſt of the Nations about them. Secondly, It is apparent that what he ſaith of their crying to the Lord, when oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by their King, would have been moſt ridiculous, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the King to have theſe Rights from God, and by his Conceſſion. When <hi>Moſes</hi> tells the Jews, <hi>That they ſhould cry unto the Lord, when they ſhould be oppreſſed by their Neighbours, waging War againſt them, becauſe of their forſaking of the Lord;</hi> Does he not plainly ſuppoſe, That
<pb facs="tcp:55979:23"/> they would do this to obtain his Protection againſt the injuſtice of thoſe Tyrants? And can any one be ſuppoſed Fool enough to imagine, that according to God's Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it was unlawful for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to defend themſelves againſt the <hi>Moabites, Philiſtims</hi> and other Nations that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed them. Thirdly, It is evident that this ſuppoſed, God could not in Juſtice puniſh a Tyrant; or if he did, it would be for making uſe of a Right, himſelf had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon him. This reaſon made <hi>R. Juda</hi> to oppoſe <hi>R. Joſe,</hi> as <hi>Kimki</hi> obſerves upon this Text. The ſame is alſo acknowledged by the wiſeſt of Divines. <hi>Marchat in horte Paſtorum, Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Tr.</hi> 4. <hi>Lect.</hi> 13. explains himſelf thus, <hi>Hoc eſt jus Regis, idem eſt ac ſi diceret, Haec eſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetudo Regum:</hi> This is the Right of a King, is the ſame as if he had ſaid, This is the Cuſtom of a King, <hi>Jus Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum, Jus non legitimum ſed uſurpatum. Eſtius. Samuel</hi> ſpeaks there not of a lawful Right of Kings, but of an uſurped and arrogated Right, and the ſame is the Opinion of <hi>Cornel. à Lapid.</hi> and the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> of <hi>Port Royal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After all that has been ſaid, it is natural to obſerve, That foraſmuch as all the ſeveral kinds of Government, are no leſs founded on Divine Authority, than the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet according to this Hypotheſis, none of them would be inveſted with this Right ſo fatal to Society, but Kings only, which certainly is the worſt Argument they could have lighted on, to recommend a Government, which God by his own inſtitution, has conſtituted a true Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond place is that of St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13. where the Apoſtle forbids reſiſting of the Powers, for fear we ſhould reſiſt the Ordinance of God. But we are to take notice, that the Apoſtle in that place does not in the leaſt touch this Queſtion, Whether it be lawful to reſiſt the Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ers, when they endeavour to overthrow the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He conſiders the Powers in the lawful uſe of their Authority, puniſhing the Evil, and protecting the Good. Now it is ridiculous to ſuppoſe, that the ſame Priviledge that appertains to him, who makes a lawful uſe of his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55979:23"/> Authority, is every whit as applicable to him who has loſt his Title by the abuſe of his Power. <hi>Rex,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Iſidore, à recte agendo dicitur; ſi enim piè &amp; juſtè &amp; miſericorditer agit, merito Rex appellatur; ſi his caruerit, non Rex, ſed Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannus eſt.</hi> A King has his name from acting right and well; for if he acts piouſly, juſtly and mercifully, he is deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called a King; but if he want theſe qualifications, he is no King, but a Tyrant. <hi>Addit.</hi> 2. <hi>ad capit. Carol Magn. cap.</hi> 21.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This would ſuppoſe the Powers that act under Sovereigns to be every whit as irreſiſtible as the Sovereigns themſelves; which is an extravagant poſition in the ſenſe of all Modern Divines. Beſides we are to obſerve that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns with their Power, are only the Organical chiefs of the Society; the true head or chief is the Principality with its Members, which are the integral parts of it. This is the ſame that was acknowledged by <hi>Charles Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> the Prince of French Lawyers, and the great defender of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and their Authority.</p>
                     <p>Upon this account it is that the People have right to proſecute the miſdemeanours of the King's Attornies and Miniſters, and to puniſh them; which would be ſtrangely ridiculous, if the State were not perſwaded, that all the Power they have, is a power received from the State, thô the King have the Power to elect and raiſe them to thoſe Employments.</p>
                     <p>It is apparent therefore, That theſe words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> only have an eye to the repugnance the Chriſtian Jews had, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to the Dominion of Heathens. This was the Opinion of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who tempted Jeſus Chriſt, upon occaſion of the Tribute which the Emperor levied in <hi>Judea; Joſephus</hi> ſhews that the <hi>Eſſenians</hi> oppoſed them in this point, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> here takes the Part of the <hi>Eſſenians.</hi> And indeed we do'nt find that the Chriſtians did any way oppoſe the Decree of the Senate, when they declared <hi>Nero,</hi> The Enemy of all Mankind. We find alſo that the Chriſtians of <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time, and thoſe that followed after, did very well agree with the Sentiment of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Authors, about the Juſtice of the People's or Senate's
<pb facs="tcp:55979:24"/> reſiſtance againſt ſuch Tyrants; as is apparent from <hi>Lactantius de Montibus Perſecutorum,</hi> and the like may be ſeen in <hi>Euſebius, Oroſius,</hi> and in St. <hi>Auguſtine de Civit. Dei.</hi> But I can ſay more than this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Scripture is ſo far from teaching the Doctrine of <hi>Non-reſiſtance</hi> to an unjuſt Power, and that violates the Laws, that ſhe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to us contrary Examples, with commendation, and ſufficiently intimates that we rather ſin in not reſiſting. For don't we ſee <hi>David</hi> taking up Arms to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt <hi>Saul?</hi> Don't we ſee him offering <hi>Achiſh</hi> to fight for him againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> notwithſtanding he was his Father-in Law? Don't we ſee the Ten Tribes oppoſing themſelves againſt <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> upon his declaring for Tyranny and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Government?</p>
                     <p>Let us take the pains heedfully to conſider the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the High-Prieſt, and his Collegues, when King <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> preſumed to exerciſe the Functions of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in offering Incenſe, and it will plainly appear, they did not think it unlawful to reſiſt Sovereign Authority, when it goes beyond its bounds, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.17. <hi>Azariah</hi> the High-Prieſt follows him with fourſcore Prieſts, all vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant men, drives him out of the Temple; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he is deprived of his Government, and his Son placed on his Throne. It cannot be alledged by theſe Gentlemen, that this happened to him becauſe of his Leproſie, becauſe they ſuppoſe that a Prince cannot be reſiſted, whatever his behaviour may be, or deveſted of the right of Governing, for any reaſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
                     <p>After all, Let us conſider how ſeverely God puniſhed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for the ſin of <hi>Saul,</hi> in breaking the Troth plighted to the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> and we ſhall find they were enveloped in the puniſhment of his ſin, becauſe they had not oppoſed themſelves againſt <hi>Saul</hi>'s breach of Faith. And we make the ſame Reflection, about the puniſhment God inflicted on the People, for their conſenting to <hi>David</hi>'s numbring of them, which God had forbid. And why ſo, but becauſe they did not oppoſe themſelves againſt this enterprize of <hi>David,</hi> as they ought to have done? We

                     <p>Laſtly, I deſire that thoſe, who talk ſo much of <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Obedience,</hi> would be pleaſed attentively to conſider the behaviour of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> when they ſhut the Gates of <hi>Modin</hi> againſt the Envoys of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and afterwards took up Arms for the defence of their Liberty and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 2. As alſo that of <hi>Matthias,</hi> who ſhut the Gates of <hi>Modin,</hi> in exhorting his Children to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their reſiſtance; and does the ſame at the hour of his Death, without believing that he was guilty of any ſin in taking up Arms; and his Children follow his Exhortations, with an extraordinary Courage and Piety.</p>
                     <p>I own that the Books which have preſerved this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are not Canonical, no more than <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who has followed them. But I muſt obſerve,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That it ſufficiently appears, what the Opinion of the Jewiſh Church was in this point; who ſtill retains an Abridgment of theſe Books, in her Books of Prayers, highly praiſing the <hi>Maccabees</hi> for their Virtue and Piety.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That the Chriſtian Church has allowed the publick reading of them, notwithſtanding they were not Canonical, and that with great eſteem too; which would have been extravagant and impious, in caſe the reſiſtance of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> had been a true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, I have ſtill more to ſay, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Eleventh of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> makes an Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> and approves the War they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook.

                        <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Whether the States can deprive Sovereigns of their Authority when they abuſe it.</head>
                     <p>THEY who maintain it is not in the Power of the Subject, juſtly to reſiſt the Authority that is once eſtabliſhed, though it abuſe the Power committed to it. believe alſo conſequently, That it is not lawful for a State to reject their Sovereign, nor to deprive him of his Authority, though he make uſe of it, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Government: but foraſmuch as the former Opinion is wholly contrary to all good Senſe, and Juſtice; the leſſer cannot be leſs ſo. I own it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt to deprive a Sovereign of the Power he enjoys, as long as he uſeth it lawfully: and in this regard it is, we muſt not attempt any thing againſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Kings, or other Sovereign Magiſtrates. I acknowledge alſo that the People may not riſe up againſt their Superiors, for the firſt Fault they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, in matter of Government, Kings being no more infallible than other Men; we cannot with juſtice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from them, that they ſhould commit no faults at all in their managing of the Government.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo evident enough that the People muſt not oppoſe themſelves againſt every thing that ſeems to have ſome air of ſeverity or hard uſage in the Government; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo orders Servants to ſuffer patiently the hard uſage of a too ſevere Maſter. Good ſenſe alone is ſufficient to inform People, That they muſt not expoſe the publick Tranquillity to danger, for ſome ſeverity,
<pb facs="tcp:55979:26"/> or for ſome intereſt which reſpects only ſome particular perſons. And indeed with this reſpect we may ſay that private perſons are obliged to ſacrifice their particular intereſt, to the publick Good and Peace. But there is a vaſt difference between a King, that governs juſtly, or that falls into ſome error, which he is willing to retract and amend upon a remonſtrance from his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and a Tyrant who overturns the Laws of the State, and the end of the Government deſignedly and of deliberate purpoſe. It would be a ſtrange delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for us to attribute to a Tyrant the Priviledges of a King; or to ſuppoſe, as otherwiſe we muſt, That there is no means to diſtinguiſh them; both which Extreams are equally ridiculous. For,</p>

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> All wiſe Men that ever were, have declared, That it is eaſie to know the difference between a King and a Tyrant. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gives us an exact <hi>Idea</hi> of a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, <hi>Polit. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>Pol.</hi> 6. <hi>Hiſt. lib.</hi> 5. gives us the Character of a Tyrant, in oppoſition to that of a King. <hi>Syneſius</hi> alſo gives us a very lively Portraiture of one <hi>de Reigno.

Bartholus,</hi> among the Lawyers, gives us a Deſcription of a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and the Characters wherewith he ſets him forth are infinitely different from thoſe that ought to be in every King.

                     <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has always been of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, before the Reformation, as appears by the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> 22. <hi>qu.</hi> 24. <hi>art.</hi> 2. of <hi>Aureolus</hi> and all the Schoolmen. In a word, we can affirm, That this was received as an indubitable Opinion, in the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> who laid it down as a Principle, whereupon they grounded their right of Depoſing the Pope.</p>
                     <p>This has always been the Opinion of Popiſh Lawyers and Canoniſts, as we may ſee in <hi>L. decerminus de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſanct. Eccleſ.</hi> in <hi>Bartholus,</hi> in <hi>tractatu de Tyrannia:</hi> in <hi>Paris de Puteo:</hi> in <hi>Syndic.</hi> where he puts the Queſtion, Whether it be lawful to kill a King that is a Tyrant.

                     <p>Neither do the Proteſtants differ from them in this point, as is evident from the Writings of <hi>Zuinglius, Luther, Calvin, Paraeus, Bilſon, Abbot,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Conringius</hi> lays it down as an indubitable truth, <hi>ad Lampadium de Imp. Rom.</hi> 119.</p>
                     <p>And the Papiſts ſince the Reformation are of the ſame judgement, as will appear, if we conſult <hi>Gregor. de Valentia, Tit.</hi> 3. <hi>diſp.</hi> 5. <hi>qu.</hi> 6. <hi>Tolet. in ſumma l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>Mariana de Rege Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. <hi>Leſſius de Jure &amp; Juſtitia Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. <hi>dub.</hi> 4. <hi>Molina tr.</hi> 3. <hi>diſp.</hi> 6. <hi>de Juſtitia &amp; jure.

                     <p>Neither let any one imagine, That this is only a Doctrine of the Jeſuites: We may ſee the contrary, in thoſe who have written concerning the Depoſition of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, and who have maintained the Juſtice of that Depoſition. And we may affirm, That among
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55979:27"/> ſo many <hi>French</hi> Authors, who have writ againſt <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who attribute the Depoſing of <hi>Childeric</hi> to Pope <hi>Zachary,</hi> and the placing <hi>Pepin</hi> on the Throne in his ſtead, there is ſcarce any to be found, who whileſt they diſpute the Pope's Right to Depoſe Kings, do not acknowledge, That it is a Right inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the States of the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>And indeed to weigh the thing in it ſelf, it is evident, That when a Prince is become the Enemy of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and endeavours to deſtroy them, he thereby loſeth the Right of Governing them. If we take the Sword out of the hand of a Madman, that he may do no hurt with it; who doubts but we have the ſame right to take away that Power from a Prince, which he makes uſe of, as if he were a Madman.</p>
                     <p>The Hiſtory of <hi>Portugal</hi> fully ſets forth to us the Judgement of that Nation, with reſpect to King <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſus</hi> III. This Prince minding nothing but hunting, his Council repreſented to him, That if he did not apply himſelf to the buſineſs of State, they would Depoſe him, and place another on the Thone. What would not they have ſaid, think we, had they ſeen him Murthering his Subjects in cold Blood, as their laſt King, whom they baniſhed, becauſe of a like madneſs.</p>
                     <p>I acknowledge, That the Commonwealth has put its rights into the hands of the Prince, by which ſhe ſeems to have deprived her ſelf of that Power. But it is a ſtrange and uncouth imagination to ſuppoſe, that a State ſhould deprive it ſelf of the right of reſiſting injuſtice and violence, which is a right, that Nature communicates to every Creature together with its Being. Beſides it is certain, That if a State be limited by Laws, and that the People are the Authors of them; ſo that they ſhare and exerciſe the Sovereign Power, in this caſe they are naturally ſuppoſed to poſſeſs and hold the
<pb facs="tcp:55979:28"/> Authority, which is neceſſary to preſerves the Right that belongs to them.</p>
                     <p>Let Men Philoſophiſe as long as they pleaſe, they ſhall never be able to make out, either that a Prince can pretend to a Power of deſtroying the Society, without any danger of being called to an account for it; or that a People can ever be eſteemed to have granted him a Right, tending to their own Ruine and Deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>But ſome may ſay, That the Title of a King, ought to ſecure a Tyrant againſt any reſiſtance, he might be liable to from his Subjects; even as the name of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a Title that puts Children out of a Condition of ſetting themſelves againſt him, whoſe cruelty they have experience of. But beſides that, there is a great deal of difference between theſe two Titles, which is the ground of the difference there is between the Subjects and a King, and the Children and a Father; is it not notorious, and practiſed every day, that a Father who is become the Enemy of his Children, is deprived of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of his Goods, and of the diſpoſal of his Children; which practice being grounded on the Law of Nature, doth not in the leaſt violate the order of the Society.</p>
                     <p>Moreover it is certain that a Title, how venerable ſo ever it may be, cannot ſecure him that bears it, from the reſiſtance of thoſe that are oppreſſed by him. Let us conceive a Phyſician, that has a deſign to Poiſon his Patient; the Title of a Phyſician which has induced his Patient to commit the care of his Health to his truſt, can it hinder the Patient from proſecuting him as a Murtherer, in caſe he reſolv'd to take away his Patients Life, inſtead of contributing to his Cure.</p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:55979:28"/>
                     <p>We know that Divines look upon the Government of the Church, as a Government inſtituted by God, and immediately inſtituted by him: and yet who knows not, that they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Pope, Biſhops and Popiſh Prieſts, by withdrawing themſelves from their Dominion, and that upon this Ground, that tho there be ſomething lawful in their Miniſtry, yet they oppoſe themſelves to the end of their Miniſtry, by reaſon of the Tyranny which they exerciſed over their Conſciences.</p>
                     <p>But ſome may imagine, that becauſe God has not expreſly given this Right to People to caſt off their Kings when turn'd Tyrants, and that he has thought it ſufficient to recommend Obedience to them, he has thereby authorized all their unjuſt Proceedings and Violence, without leaving any means to the People of oppoſing themſelves againſt their Oppreſſion by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them. This is a meer Deluſion; and to ſee through it, we need only conſider God's Silence concerning the irregular comportment of the High Prieſt, who notwithſtanding was ſubject to the ſame Puniſhments, as were the meaneſt Levites, in caſe of his violating the Rules of his Inſtitution, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing the Laws which God had given to all the People of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and to the Prieſts in particular. Indeed, it was not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that God ſhould preſcribe any ſuch thing to the People, becauſe Nature alone is ſufficient to teach People aright they are poſſeſſed of, by giving their Conſent to the Elevation of the Powers that govern them. In a word, I ſay, that God had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently intimated to the Iſraelites, that they could not lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be oppreſſed, in that he had expreſly forbid their Kings to heap up vaſt Riches, or to multiply the Number of their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, which the Kings could not do without violating the Law of God, and without drawing upon themſelves the Reſiſtance and Oppoſition of their Subjects; as <hi>Joſephus</hi> very well infers, who maintains, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <q>That the People ought of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to oppoſe themſelves againſt a Prince, who tranſgreſs'd the Bounds God had preſcribed to him in the 17th of <hi>Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this Point leads us inſenſibly to conſider more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what kind of Royalty it was, that obtained amongſt the Jews, which deſerves carefully to be examined. This I intend next to conſider, and afterwards ſhall proceed to take a view what was the Law of Royalty among the <hi>Romans;</hi> and ſhall
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55979:29"/> make it appear, that the Kingdoms of <hi>Europe,</hi> which have been formed out of the Ruins of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, have neither followed the one nor the other of theſe Models, tho ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have aſſerted it without reſpect to Truth.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Concerning Regal Dignity, and the Rights belonging to it amongst the Jews.</head>
                     <p>I Am to make out four Things in order to the clearing of the Character of Royalty, which obtain'd amongſt the Jews.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, to enquire, whether it was immediately eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God?</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly, To ſhew, that it was limited according to the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have of it in the 17th of <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3ly, To evince ſolidly, that all that <hi>Samuel</hi> declared concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Right of Kings, was only a Prophecy about the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Kings, and not the Right of Royalty.</p>
                     <p n="4">4ly, To make it appear, that ſuppoſing that of <hi>Samuel</hi>'s, to be a Deſcription of a Lawful Right, yet that particular Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could not be of any Conſequence to thoſe Eſtates that had another Inſtitution.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, I ſay, that the Inſtitution of ſome Magiſtrates amongſt the Jews, was by expreſs and immediate Revelation from God: <hi>Moſes</hi> his Miniſtry and Authority was eſtabliſhed and confirmed by miraculous Signs and Tokens, as appears <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. And for the Judges of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as may be ſeen in the 18th Chapter of the ſame Book; But we find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like this, in the eſtabliſhment of the Kingly Authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. For we do not find that God, in the 17th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> enjoins the People to eſtabliſh a King over them, as the Jews themſelves believe; but only that he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw the diſorderly Inclinations of the People, who in Time to come would demand a King to rule over them, in conformity to thoſe of their Neighbour Nations. A demonſtrative Proof of what I ſay is, becauſe that God himſelf having declared himſelf
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55979:29"/> ſolemnly to be their King, in giving them Laws, in leading their Armies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they could not reject him without committing a great Sin. This is that which <hi>Gideon</hi> was very ſenſible of, as appears by his abſolute refuſal of the Royal Dignity. The ſame thing may alſo be gathered from the words of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. and of God himſelf.</p>
                     <p>I own indeed, that when the People ſhewed themſelves obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately reſolv'd to have a King, there happened ſomething of an immediate deſignation of <hi>Saul</hi> to that Dignity, as may be ſeen 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. for the Election was made by caſting of Lots in the preſence of <hi>Samuel,</hi> to ſhew that the appointment of <hi>Saul</hi> was immediately from God. But for all this it continues a great Truth, That the eſtabliſhment of the Royal Power in <hi>Iſrael</hi> was an Act of the People, and not an immediate Act of the Deity. And we ought to give the more heed to what was immediate in the Inſtitution, becauſe it is the Foundation of many particular Expreſſions we find in Scripture; when it is ſaid of the Judges of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 1.17. That their Judgment was God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; That they are Gods, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.16. &amp; 22.8, 9, 28. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.1. <hi>John</hi> 10.35. That God is with them in their Judgment, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.6. All thoſe Expreſſio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s refer to their immediate Divine Inſtitution. When the Scripture, ſpeaking of the Kings of <hi>Judea,</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Solomon ſat upon the Throne of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.23. that is to ſay, that God had placed him on the Throne of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which God himſelf was poſſeſt of, till their demanding a King of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.8. When it calls them the <hi>Kings of God,</hi> 1 Sam. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.50. and <hi>his Anointed Ones,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.51. which Title is given to <hi>Saul,</hi> as well as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Joſiah;</hi> all thoſe Expreſſions reſpect God's Eſtabliſhment of Kings, after that the People had earneſtly and obſtinately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be govern'd by their Miniſtry.</p>
                     <p>As to the ſecond Head which reſpects the Laws that God preſcribes to the Jews, to regulate the Choice, and the Conduct of their future Kings, ſet down by <hi>Moſes,</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.</p>
                     <p>We may therein obſerve theſe two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt. That God ſuppoſeth, that foraſmuch as they would ſome time after ſet up a King over them, they would alſo ſuppoſe it lawful for them, to preſcribe to the Royal Power, the Form
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55979:30"/> and Rules which their Neighbour-Nations, amongſt themſelves, had ſet to that Form of Government.</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly, That God leaving to the People the natural Right of limiting the Royalty amongſt themſelves, according to their own liking and fancy, or for giving it more ſcope and liberty, as their Neighbours had done, only thought good to preſcribe to them theſe Rules and Limitations. 1. God limits their choice as to the Perſon of a King, that he muſt be one choſen by himſelf. 2. They might not chooſe a Stranger. 3. He do's not allow the King to multiply Horſes; 4. Nor to lead back the People to <hi>Egypt;</hi> 5. Nor to have great ſtore of Wives; 6. Nor to heap up vaſt Riches. 7. He enjoyns him to ſtudy the Law of God, and have it always with him to obſerve and keep it. And, 8. To do Juſtice equally to all without diſtinction.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the Laws which <hi>Joſephus</hi> hath compendiouſly ſet down, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>p.</hi> 123, after <hi>Philo,</hi> in his Treatiſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>the Creation of the Prince.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now it is natural and obvious, to conclude from all this; 1. That God doth not in that place proſcribe a plat-form of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy for the Government of the Jews; but only ſuppoſeth that the Jews, being deſirous of Monarchy, would be apt to borrow the Model of it from the Neighbour-Kingdoms. 2. That in preſcribing ſome Rules concerning the choice and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of a King, he endeavors to prevent the State of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from falling into the Inconveniences, into which their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Nations had caſt themſelves, by allowing their Kings, or at leaſt ſuffering them to take too great a Power and Authority, whether in Matters of State or Religion. 3. That he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that the People ought to oblige the King to obſerve theſe Laws of God, and that they might oppoſe themſelves to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who at any time ſhould have the boldneſs to violate them; as <hi>Joſephus</hi> expreſſeth himſelf in the place quoted before. 4. That he allows the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> the ſame Rights to oppoſe themſelves againſt the unjuſt Enterprizes of their Princes, turn'd Tyrants, which other Nations were poſſeſt of againſt their Princes, when they abuſed their Authority: the Reaſon why People deſire a King, being, that he may Judg and Govern them, not that he ſhould Deſtroy them by playing the Tyrant.</p>
                     <p>It is of importance to make theſe Obſervations, becauſe it appears that in all this God did ſo far accommodate himſelf to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55979:30"/> the Deſign of the Jews, that he never pretended to carry his Laws any farther: for we ſee he does not ſpeak to them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Manner how they ought to behave themſelves, when they ſhould be attak'd or ſubjugated by Foreign Powers, as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that common ſenſe would be ſufficient to inſtruct them, that in thoſe Caſes they were to follow the Example of other Nations, who bore patiently the Yoke of the Prince that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd them.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things thus laid down, it clearly appears, that God ſet Bounds to the Royal Power, long before he eſtabliſhed any King in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that the Jews could not but believe, that Kings had another Law ſet them than that of their own Wills.</p>
                     <p>Indeed we ſee, 1ſt, That this Inſtitution did not at all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from the Rights of the People, to chooſe their own Kings, under certain Conditions, and by a form of Treaty, Compact, or Capitulation. We find that the Election of <hi>Jephtha,</hi> Judg. 11.10. clearly ſuppoſeth this, as likewiſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the ſame may be ſeen in the Election of <hi>Saul, David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.8. and 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.24. We find that <hi>Iſhbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth</hi> was brought into the Camp by <hi>Abner,</hi> only to ſhow him to the People, that they might conſent to the choice of him, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.9.</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly, Though this Inſtitution ſeem to be immediate, yet did it not at all hinder or prejudg the Peoples Right of making Treaties and Capitulations with their Prince, and conſequently of rejecting them, when at any time they ſhould invade or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the ſaid Rights and Capitulations. And of this we have an illuſtrious Example in the Sons of <hi>Samuel,</hi> whoſe ill admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration gave the Jews an occaſion to demand a King, by which means <hi>Samuel</hi> himſelf was, as we may ſay, obliged to renounce his Power as Judg, which notwithſtanding he had received immediately from God himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="3">3ly, How immediate ſoever the Kings of <hi>Juda</hi> may have been eſtabliſhed by God, yet they never had the Character of an Arbitrary and unbounded Power, as is ſuppos'd by thoſe, who would infer, that becauſe Monarchy was inſtituted by God, the Power of him that is inveſted with it cannot be juſtly limited, neither can, for any Miſdemeanour whatſoever, be depoſed.</p>
                     <p>To make it more ſenſible and evident, we need only take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what the Scripture tells us in ſeveral places.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:55979:31"/>1ſt. They could not alienate the Lands and Countries that belonged to the State, to any Strangers, neither could they take them from their Subjects by way of Truck or Exchange, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from that Hiſtory of <hi>Naboth,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly. They could not invade the Sacerdotal Functions, as is apparent from the Hiſtory of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzia,</hi> who was boldly and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly reſiſted by the High Prieſt <hi>Azaria</hi> and his Colleagues, 2 Chron. 26.18.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They could not conſtrain the Levites to go to War; that Tribe being excepted from all the reſt, who were ſubject to that Service, as <hi>Abulenſis</hi> owns it, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.22.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They could impoſe no Tributes but in caſe of Neceſſity, and with the conſent of the People; and thoſe who have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to do otherwiſe, have been cenſured therefore by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.1. Not to mention, that the exceſſive Tributes <hi>Solomon</hi> impoſed on the People, were the cauſe of the ten Tribes ſhaking off <hi>Rehoboam</hi>'s Yoke, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.3.</p>
                     <p n="4">4ly. I ſay that though God had ſeemed, to fix the Royal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to one Family, to wit, that of <hi>David,</hi> yet was it not ſo bound up, that the Succeſſion muſt always paſs from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the eldeſt Son, and not to the younger. Thus we ſee that <hi>Solomon</hi> was preferred to <hi>Adonijah</hi> by <hi>David,</hi> by the conſent of the People. Thus <hi>Rehoboam</hi> deſigned to ſettle the Succeſſion upon <hi>Abijah</hi> the Son of <hi>Maachah,</hi> as thinking him moſt fit for Government, though he had elder Brothers, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.22. <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> on the contrary preferred <hi>Jehoram</hi> to the Succeſſion before all his other Sons, becauſe he was his Firſt-born, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.3.</p>
                     <p>All which evidently proves that both Kings and People, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelves to have right, from the Divine Graunt or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for the Eſtabliſhment of Kings, to regulate the Rights of Royalty, and the Queſtions depending thereon, according to the Maxims of Political Prudence, and the Rights of Nations.</p>
                     <p>Neither do we find that <hi>Samuel</hi> grounds his Diſcourſe on any other Principles, or that he ſuppoſes that Kings ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with a boundleſs Power, as ſome imprudently do ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. See in what manner he expreſſeth himſelf, to diſwade the Jews from their importunate Demand to have him ſettle a King over them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, to the end. <hi>And it came to paſs, that when</hi> Samuel <hi>was old, that he made his Sons
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55979:31"/> Judges over</hi> Iſrael. <hi>But his Sons walked not in his ways, but turned aſide after Lucre, and took Bribes, and preverted Judgment. Then all the Elders of</hi> Iſrael <hi>aſſembled themſelves together, and came to</hi> Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el <hi>unto</hi> Ramah, <hi>and ſaid unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy Sons walk not in thy ways; now therefore make us a King to judg us like other Nations. But the thing diſpleaſed</hi> Samuel, <hi>when they ſaid, Give us a King to judg us. And</hi> Samuel <hi>prayed unto the Lord, and the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Samuel, <hi>Hearken unto the Voice of the People, in all that they ſay unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I ſhould not reign over them. According to all the Works which they have done, ſince the day that I brought them up out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>even unto this day, wherewith they have forſaken me, and ſerved other Gods, ſo do they alſo unto thee. Now therefore hearken unto their Voice, howbeit proteſt ſolemnly unto them, and ſhew to them the manner of the King that ſhall reign over them. And</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel <hi>told all the Words of the Lord unto the People that asked of him a King; and he ſaid, This will be the manner of the King that ſhall reign over you, he will take your Sons, and appoint them for himſelf, for his Chariots, and to be his Horſemen, and ſome ſhall run before his Chariot; and he will appoint him Captains over thouſands, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains over Fifities, and will ſet them to ear his Ground, and to reap his Harveſt, and to make his Inſtruments of War, and Inſtruments of his Chariots; and he will take your Daughters to be his Confectioners, and to be his Cooks and Bakers. And he will take your Fields and your Vine-yards, and your Olive-Yards, even the beſt of them, and give them to his Servants. And he will take the tenth of your Seed, and of your Vineyards, to beſtow it upon his Officers and his Servants. And he will take your Men-Servants and your Maid-Servants, and the goodlieſt of your young Men, and your Aſſes, and put them to his Work. He will take the tenth of your Sheep, and ye ſhall be his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: And ye ſhall cry out in that Day becauſe of your King, which ye ſhall have choſen you, and the Lord will not hear you in that Day. Nevertheleſs the People refuſed to obey the Voice of</hi> Samuel; <hi>and they ſaid, Nay, but we will have a King over us, that we alſo may be like all the Nations, and that our King may judg us, and go out before us, and fight our Battels.</hi> And Samuel <hi>heard all the Words of the People, and he rehearſed them in the Ears of the Lord. And the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Samuel, <hi>Hearken unto their Voice, and make them a King: and</hi> Samuel <hi>ſaid unto the Men of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Go ye every Man unto his City.</hi>

                     <p>'Tis obvious to obſerve from this account: 1ſt. That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and Miſcarriage of <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Sons was the cauſe why the Jews demanded a King to be ſet over them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly. That their Demand is couch'd in thoſe terms, that make it evident, they deſired to be governed after the manner of their Neighbour-Nations. 3ly. That this their Demand was diſpleaſing to <hi>Samuel.</hi> 4ly. That God look'd upon it as a Contempt of himſelf, and a caſting off of his Authority, for the Reaſons before alledged. 5ly. That God ſtrictly enjoyns <hi>Samuel</hi> to proteſt and declare unto them, how they muſt expect to be treated by the Kings that ſhould reign over them. 6ly. That <hi>Samuel</hi> in this his Declaration delineates to them the compleat Pourtraiture of a Tyrant rather than of a King, to affright the People from the Demand they had made; and that as a Prophet he foretells the things ſhould happen to them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Government of their Kings. 7ly. That he repreſents to them the Miſeries annex'd to Royalty, as their Bondage in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the ſeveral other Servitudes, which had forced them to cry unto God, but denounces to them, that God, to puniſh them for this their Rebellion againſt him, and their Contempt of his Adminiſtration, would not hear them. 8ly. That the People dazled with the Luſtre of Royalty, and the Advantages they thence promiſed to themſelves; in time of War, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this Remonſtrance, perſevered in their Demand. 9ly. That finally therefore God commands <hi>Samuel</hi> to give way to their Requeſt, and to ſet a King over them according to their Deſire.</p>
                     <p>This in ſhort is the ſenſe, which <hi>Joſephus</hi> gives of this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.<note place="margin">Antiq. lib. c. <hi>4.</hi>
                        </note> From whence it is evident, that the Synagogue never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that God had granted to the Kings of <hi>Judea,</hi> any of thoſe Tyrannical Rights, which ſome would appropriate to Kings from theſe Words, <hi>Hoc eſt jus Regis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Joſephus</hi> makes out, that what is ſaid, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.25. that <hi>Samuel</hi> wrote the Right (or rather the Manners and Behaviour) of a King <hi>in a Book, and laid it up before the Lord,</hi> was done by him for this end, that the People for time to come might know, that he, as a Prophet, had, in this his deſcription of the Manners of a King,<note place="margin">Ibid. cap. <hi>5.</hi>
                        </note> foretold them all the Calamities and Miſeries that would overtake them under a Monarchy, chang'd into Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that thereby they might be induc'd to Acknowledge their
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55979:32"/> unthankfulneſs towards God, and their Folly in being ſo earneſt for a King, as often as they ſhould caſt their Eyes on this his Prophecy.</p>
                     <p>I know that ſome to aſſert the unbounded Power of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, have endeavoured to prove from theſe Words of the vulgar Latin Tranſlation, <hi>hoc eſt jus Regis,</hi> that the Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Government amongſt the Jews was of this Nature, and that therefore <hi>Samuel</hi> does not repreſent the Kings here as ſubject to any Laws or Puniſhments, which it ſeems he conſequently ought to have done, after that he had declared their Conduct and Behaviour, as abſolutely contrary to the Rights of the Society.</p>
                     <p>But as I have already before obſerved, never was ſo weak a Foundation made uſe of, whereon to raiſe ſuch vaſt Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as may be eaſily made out ſo as to convince thoſe, who make uſe of an improper Tranſlation, both to delude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to abuſe others, about a Queſtion which is of ſo great Importance to the Society.</p>
                     <p>Now that <hi>Samuel</hi> had not any the leaſt Deſign to appropriate an unbounded Power to the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. by theſe Words, <hi>hoc eſt jus Regis,</hi> appears 1ſt. Becauſe the word <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>path</hi> ordinarily ſignifies, <hi>conſuetudo, agendi ratio,</hi> a cuſtom, manner or way of acting, in caſe we do not explain this word in the ſame ſenſe it carries in the 2d. <hi>chap.</hi> of the ſame Book, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. we ſhall make this paſſage to contradict <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. which cannot be otherwiſe avoided.

                     <p n="3">3. The Divines that did not underſtand <hi>Hebrew,</hi> yet by good ſenſe and Reaſon were led to the true meaning of this word. <hi>Gerſon</hi> lays it down as a certain Truth, that this word does not expreſs a lawful Right, but an unjuſt Power. <hi>Dictio haec [Jus] non ſignificat ſemper Jurisdictionem, ſive Juſtitiam, ſed ſignificat interdum Poteſtatem quae non eſt juſta,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſicut haec dictio Rex, quandoque ſumitur pro Tyranno, &amp; Benedictio, pro maledictione, &amp; Lex injuſtitiae, pro injuſtitiae execratione, &amp; Deus pro Diabolo.</hi> This word <hi>[Jus]</hi> doth not always ſignifie Right or Juſtice; but ſometimes an unjuſt Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> even as alſo the word King, is ſometimes taken for a Tyrant, and Bleſſing for Curſing, and the law of unrighteouſneſs, for the execrable unrighteouſneſs, and God for the Devil. <hi>Opuſc. contr. Adulator. Princip. in Conſid.</hi> 8.</p>
                     <p>The ſame alſo was the Judgment of <hi>Claudius Eſpenſeus</hi> a famous Divine of the Romiſh Church, who told <hi>Henry</hi> II of <hi>France:</hi> Your Majeſty ought to abhor that Right nothing leſs than Regal, and nothing more than Tyrannical, which God by the mouth of <hi>Samuel</hi> did not allow the King, but wherewith he threatned the People, ſaying, <hi>Hoc erit Jus Regis,</hi> this will be the Right of a King. Treatiſe of the Inſtitution of a Prince <hi>Ch.</hi> 8.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It appears evidently that <hi>Samuel</hi> repreſents to us the picture of a Tyrant, in oppoſition to the deſcription of a King, God had ſet down in the 17 <hi>chap.</hi> of <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Jews of old have always owned as much, as appears from <hi>Joſephus, Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It appears that thoſe who conceive the matter otherwiſe, ſuppoſe a greater Power and Authority in Princes, than they aſcribe to God himſelf, who never commands any Thing but what is reaſonable and juſt; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> judged, who calls all the Duty we owe to God, a Reaſonable Service, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. If any one will take the pains to read the Characters <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> has given of a King, in divers places of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> he ſhall find that nothing can be more oppoſite to this <hi>Idea</hi> of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded Power, which ſome would gather from theſe words of <hi>Samuel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> never enjoyed any ſuch Power, or ever pretended to it: the Hiſtory of <hi>Naboth,</hi> whoſe Vineyard
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55979:33"/> King <hi>Ahab</hi> greatly deſired, is a proof hereof beyond all excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 1. <hi>Kings ch.</hi> 21. <hi>Jezebel</hi> would never have been put to the trouble, to employ falſe Witneſſes to deſtroy <hi>Naboth</hi> as a Blaſphemer, if ſhe had had in <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſome of thoſe Divines, Flatterers of the Grandeur of Princes, who abuſe the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to authorize all the injuſtice and oppreſſion they are guilty of. I am ſure it is impoſſible to read without aſtoniſhment the extravagance of ſome Divines, who conceive that the words of <hi>Samuel</hi> contain an Explication of the Rights of Royalty, and that <hi>Samuel</hi> wrote them in a Book as being the publick and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtable Rights of Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>Withal let us make this Reflection which is very natural: The Jews here complain of the injuſtice and violence of <hi>Samuel's</hi> Sons, who made a mock of the Laws; whereupon 'tis ſuppoſed that they to remedy this miſchief, require of <hi>Samuel</hi> to ſet a King over them, that might govern them according to his own Fancy, and treat them like Slaves: Is there any thing of ſenſe in the Suppoſition? We ſuppoſe that the King has already a Rule preſcrib'd him in the 17 of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and at the ſame Time we maintain that <hi>Samuel</hi> a Prophet, has in a publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord ſet down the Deſcription of a Tyrant, to whom God gives Right, to violate all the Rules he had preſcribed in his Law. Sure it is that neither the Antient nor Modern Jews, did ever conceive any ſuch thing. If we read <hi>Joſephus,</hi> where he ſets down an abridgment of the 17 of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> we ſhall find that he expreſly aſſerts, that it was not only the Right, but alſo the Duty of the People to oppoſe themſelves againſt their Deſigns in caſe they violate the Rules of the Royalty God had preſcribed them. Let us conſider the carriage of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> againſt <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and we ſhall find that they did not believe it unlawful to reſiſt Tyrants, and to oppoſe themſelves to their deſtructive Government.</p>
                     <p>Let any one read the 14 of the firſt Book of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> and he will ſee whether the Rights of the King, which at that Time were engraven on Braſs, had any reſemblance with what we find in the 8th <hi>chap.</hi> of <hi>Samuel.</hi> This is a ſure way to judge whether the Jews ever pretended that God, by theſe words of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> had granted to Kings an unlimited Power. They to this day acknowledg, that the Scripture does not only preſcribe Moral Laws, which their Kings could not violate; but alſo
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55979:34"/> poſitive Laws, to which they were obnoxious, and which they could not tranſgreſs, without ſubmitting themſelves to the ſame puniſhments with the reſt of their Subjects. This is the common opinion of the Jews, as we may ſee in <hi>Maimonides de Regibus Cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. and in the treatiſe of the <hi>Sanhedrim cap.</hi> 19. <hi>num.</hi> 166, 167, 168. which Doctrine he borrowed from the <hi>Talmud cap. Cohen Gadol,</hi> and from <hi>Siphri</hi> upon the <hi>Paraſche Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetim.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2ly, They hold that if the King did change the form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment into Tyranny, the People had Right to reject him. The Hiſtory of <hi>Rehoboam</hi> rejected by the ten Tribes, is a proof hereof beyond exception.</p>
                     <p n="3">3ly, They hold that the People ſuppos'd themſelves to have Right, and that it was their Duty to reject <hi>Athaliah,</hi> who tho ſhe was a Woman, yet had invaded the Throne, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 11 <hi>ch. ver.</hi> 3. which the Jews pretend to be contrary to the Law ſet down in the 17 of <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4ly, They declare that King <hi>Herod</hi> appeared as a Criminal and indicted Perſon before the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> tho they miſtake themſelves in the ſtory related by <hi>Joſephus lib.</hi> 14. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. <hi>Antiq.</hi> whence it appears that he was only <hi>Vice-Roy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I acknowledge that <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> Exercit. 13. §. 3. (from whence Biſhop <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> ſeems to have taken it) maintains, that the Jews believe, That no Creature can judge the King but God alone; and to this purpoſe quotes a paſſage out of <hi>Midraſch Devarim Rabba</hi> in <hi>Shophetim:</hi> but it is now 64 Years ſince <hi>Schickard</hi> has obſerved <hi>Caſaubon</hi>'s miſtake, in handling a matter he did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; for indeed the Jewiſh Maxims are directly oppoſite to it. 1ſt. In the place by him cited, we find a Gloſs, which ſhews that that paſſage did not concern the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> but thoſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who by their Power had changed the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into Tyranny. <hi>Schickard de Jure Regio, pag.</hi> 63, 64. and trampled under Feet the Laws of God, which made them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to puniſhment. 2ly, We muſt obſerve that the Jews believ'd, that the Maxime never took place, but a little before the laſt extirpation of their States, upon occaſion of one of their laſt Kings named <hi>Jamneus, Gemar</hi> in <hi>cap.</hi> 2 <hi>Sanhedrim.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I own that <hi>Samuel</hi> doth not ſet down any expreſs Law for the depoſing of Kings, or puniſhing of them when turn'd Tyrants: but yet he ſuppoſed as a thing certain and evident, 1ſt. That
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55979:34"/> their Crimes being contrary to the Law, were puniſhable accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the general Definitions of the Law againſt Idolaters and other Criminals: We don't find that God has ſpoken any thing in particular neither concerning the High-Prieſt, from whence the Papiſts falſly conclude, That he was exempt from Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tho he did tranſgreſs the Law. 2ly, I ſay that tho the Execution of thoſe Laws was not committed to Inferiour Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, yet did it of right belong to the publick, according to the natural Dictates of common Senſe.</p>
                     <p>But after all, whatſoever <hi>Idea</hi> we may frame of the Jewiſh Monarchy, I maintain that it cannot be of any conſequence to other States. 1ſt. Becauſe that State was formed immediately by God, for particular Ends which do not reſpect other Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. God might, by Example, grant to the Family of <hi>David,</hi> which he had a mind to diſtinguiſh from others, ſome Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, which he had no deſign to communicate to other So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns. 2ly, Becauſe it is falſe that God has granted any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Right to the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> contenting himſelf to give way to the Peoples deſire, who would be govern'd by a King like their Neighbours. 3ly, Becauſe whatever the Rights of Royalty may have been amongſt the Jews, it is certain they have been aboliſhed by an Order of Providence, which has wholly deſtroy'd the State of the Jews, and the Rights of their Kings. We don't find that Jeſus Chriſt obliged his Followers to regulate their Obedience to Soveraigns, according to the meaſure of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience the Jews rendred to their Kings. 4ly, Neither do we ſee, that the Jews ſince their diſperſion did ever take part with Tyrants, when the States where they lived rejected them, or that they thought themſelves oblig'd thereto by the Law. 5ly, We ſhould be forced to ſuppoſe that all the Chriſtian States, and all the Biſhops and Paſtors in the Churches and States with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Roman Empire, had been pitifully miſtaken in not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing or recommending this Judaical Form of Deſpotical Royalty, and purely Tyrannical, deſcribed by <hi>Samuel,</hi> which is ſo ſtrangely extravagant, that it is unworthy to inſiſt on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of it.</p>

                     <p>'TIS a difficult thing to underſtand the Nature of the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Governments, without being acquainted with the Nature of the Government of the Roman Emperors, of that Empire, whoſe Ruin has been the riſe of moſt of the Weſtern Monarchies.

                        <p>Theſe are the chief Articles of the Royal Law, which were engraven in Marble, from whence <hi>Antonius Auguſtinus</hi> copied
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55979:36"/> them. This Marble ſtood in the Palace of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Lateran,</hi> and was engraven under the Reign of <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We are to obſerve, for the better underſtanding of this Law;</p>
                        <p n="1">1ſt, That it was extorted, <hi>Vi &amp; Metu,</hi> by Force and Fear, as <hi>Dion Caſſius</hi> tells us, <hi>Lib.</hi> 53. Indeed, we read in <hi>Cicero</hi> againſt <hi>Verres, Regiè ſeu potius Tyrannicè ſtatuit;</hi> He ordain'd King-like, or rather Tyrant-like. There is but little appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that the Law was called <hi>Lex Regia,</hi> or the Royal Law, the Emperors chuſing rather to take that Title, which ſignified only the General of an Army, than that of Kings, which the People of <hi>Rome</hi> had an horror for, ever ſince the <hi>Tarquins.</hi> And <hi>Dion Caſſius</hi> relates in the before-cited place, with what ſweetneſs <hi>Auguſtus</hi> always carried it towards the Senate, and how great a ſhare he left in the Adminiſtration of the Affairs of the Empire, reſerving chiefly for himſelf the Care and Conduct of the Provinces, which were expoſed to the Violence of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                        <p n="2">2ly, That the wiſeſt of the Roman Emperors have condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Government which this Law ſuppoſeth, for a Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Government. This was the Judgment of the Emperor <hi>Pertinax,</hi> in a Speech of his to the Senate, ſet down by <hi>Herodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> pag. 372 <hi>Edit. Steph.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3ly, That after all, <hi>Juſtinian</hi> agrees, that the People of <hi>Rome</hi> had transferred all the Power upon the Perſon of the Emperor: See how he expreſſeth himſelf; <hi>Cum enim Lege antiquâ, qua Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia nuncupatur, omne jus, omniſque poteſtas Populi Rom. in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratoriam tranſlata ſint poteſtatem. Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cod. de veter. Jure enncleando, &amp; tit. de Jure Naturae &amp; Gentium &amp; Civili.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4ly, That by this Law the Roman Emperors were not above all Laws, but ſome Laws only, being ſubject to the reſt as well as any of their Subjects.</p>
                        <p n="5">5ly, That the Power which the People of <hi>Rome</hi> had granted to their Emperors, expired together with them, and was fain to be renewed upon every Succeſſion.</p>
                        <p n="6">6ly, That what-ever was done in virtue of this Law, before ſuch renewal of it, did make the Doer of Right liable to Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:55979:36"/>
                        <p>But however thus much is apparent, That though the Roman Emperors were above certain Laws; yet they had not wholly depriv'd the Common-Wealth of their Authority, nor the People of their Liberty, of which we can give ſome very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Inſtances.</p>
                        <p n="1">1ſt, This Royal Law did not overthrow the Propriety of the Subject, as appears from the recital of <hi>Bodin,</hi> concerning <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian,</hi> who himſelf was obliged to demand leave of a Widow to pull down her Houſe, for to build the Church of <hi>Sancta So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> which ſhe had refuſed the Lords he had ſent to deſire her to ſurrender her Houſe to him.</p>
                        <p n="2">2ly, It did not expoſe the Subjects to the blind Fury of the Emperors, otherwiſe it would have been a great Folly in <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi> to have undergone the Publick Penance which St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> laid upon him, for having caus'd ſome of the Inhabitants of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> to be murther'd by his Souldiers, for aſſiſting in a popular Sedition, where a General of his Army had been kill'd.</p>
                        <p n="3">3ly, The Emperors never pretended that the People were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their Slaves: In which Point the <hi>Romans</hi> differ'd from the <hi>Perſians,</hi> which made <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſay, ſpeaking of <hi>Maximian,</hi> as of a Tyrant; <hi>Poſt devictos Perſas, quorum hic ritus, hic mos eſt, ut Regibus ſuis in Servitium ſe addicant, &amp; Reges Populo ſuo, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam familia utantur, hunc morem nefarius homo in Romanam ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram voluit inducere, quem ex illo tempore victoriae, ſine pudore, lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat.</hi> After he had overcome the <hi>Perſians,</hi> whoſe Cuſtom and Manner it is to be Slaves to their Kings, the Kings uſing their People as their Servants and Domeſticks, this wicked Man was willing to introduce the ſame Cuſtom amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> which from the time of his this Victory he commended without all ſhame.</p>
                        <p n="4">4ly, The Emperors made no alterations in the Laws, though they attributed to themſelves the right of interpreting them, and to enact new Ones upon emergent Occaſions.</p>
                        <p>The Right of aſſembling the Senate, and the Nomination to Offices and Places of Truſt, as well as the Power of appointing Governours in the Provinces, which before were left to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of the Senate, was the greateſt Right of the Emperors.</p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:55979:37"/>
                        <p>The Right of making Peace and War, was of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: There was only this difference, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Right was granted to the Emperors for ever, whereas it was but rarely granted to the Generals which <hi>Rome</hi> formerly nominated.</p>
                        <p>And as for the Right of not being ſubject to Laws, that was only a Right limited to certain Laws, and was not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood with reſpect to all Laws whatſoever; Accordingly we ſee, 1ſt. That the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine</hi> expreſſeth himſelf thus: <hi>Contra Jus reſcripta non valeant, quocunque modo fuerint impetrata. Quod enim publica Jura praeſcribunt, magis ſequi Judices debent.</hi> Orders contrary to Law are invalid, which way ſoever they be obtain'd. For the Judges ought to keep themſelves to what the Publick Laws preſcribe, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cod. Theod. de diverſ. reſcript.</hi> The Emperors, <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Valentinian,</hi> ſpeak yet more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly; <hi>Digna vox eſt Majeſtate Regnantis, legibus alligatum ſe Principem profiteri. Adeo de Authoritate Juris, noſtra pendet Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritas.</hi> It is a ſaying worthy of the Majeſty of a Ruler, for a Prince to profeſs himſelf bound by the Laws: ſo far does all our Authority depend upon the Authority of the Law. <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cod. de Leg. &amp; conſtitut. Princip.</hi> We ſee in the ſecond place, that the Senate ſentences <hi>Nero,</hi> without believing that by this Act they violated the Oaths they ſwore to the Emperors every New-years day. The Senate declares ſome Emperors, as <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> Enemies of the State, and arm their Subjects to deſtroy them, and make void all their Acts: which makes it evident, that tho the Emperors often boaſt themſelves of their not being tied to Law, yet they were fain to approve the Proceedings of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate againſt their Predeceſſors. The Reaſon of this Conduct is, that though it be a general Compact of Humane Society to obey Kings, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>confeſſ. c.</hi> 8. yet it is no leſs notorious, that this Compact doth not reſpect Tyrants.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly we ſee that the wiſeſt of the Emperors did ſo little believe that it was lawful for them to govern arbitrarily, that <hi>Trajan,</hi> in favour of whom the Royal Law was renewed, at the time of his exaltation to the Empire, addreſſeth himſelf in theſe words to the Prefect of the <hi>Praetorium; Accipe hunc gladium, pro me ſi rectè agam; ſin aliter, in me magis; quod mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratorem omnium errare minus fas ſit;</hi> Take this Sword and uſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55979:37"/> it for me, in caſe I rule well; but if not, rather againſt me; becauſe it leſs becomes him that rules over all, than it does others, to commit an Error. <hi>Dion. &amp; Aurel. Victor.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2ly, That the Emperors, who were moſt renowned for Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, did never affect to publiſh any Laws of their own Heads, till after they had got them approved by the Senate. This is that which <hi>Lampridius</hi> records concerning <hi>Alexander Severus;</hi> and we ſee the ſame practis'd by <hi>Theodoſius, l. Humanum C. de F.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But whatever this Royal Law may have been, ſure it is,</p>
                        <p n="1">1ſt, That the ſame was aboliſhed together with the Roman Empire, which ended in the Weſt with <hi>Auguſtulus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2ly, That it ceaſed in the Eaſt with the Emperors of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3ly, It is certain that they who ruin'd the Empire in the Weſt, did never adopt this Royal Law, to govern their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by that Arbitrary Rule.</p>
                        <p n="4">4ly, It is alſo certain that the Princes, who ſince the Year 800 have ſucceeded <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and who have taken to themſelves the Names of <hi>Roman Emperors,</hi> did not govern ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Law, nor ever pretended that that Law ought to be obſerved in favour of them, under pretence of their bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Title of <hi>Roman Emperors.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is that, which I believe it will be of uſe ſolidly to evince, though I intend to do it very compendiouſly, that I may not tire the Reader.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> That the States of the Weſt, and of the North, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew this Royal Law.</head>
                     <p>THough the People of the Weſt allow'd their Princes the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of King, yet it may be averr'd, that the moſt part of thoſe Kingdoms, which had their Riſe from the Ruins of the Roman Empire, never owned this Royal Law. The Power of their Kings was originally limited, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> witneſſeth in his Commentaries concerning the German Kings, which were, to ſpeak properly, only Commanders or Generals. I make parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular mention of the Germans, becauſe, for the moſt part, they were the Founders of the Northern and Weſtern King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; <hi>Germany</hi> having been, as it were, the Nurſery, from whence have proceeded moſt of thoſe Nations, who at this Day have any Name in <hi>Europe.</hi> See what <hi>Tacitus</hi> aſſerts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the German Kings; <hi>Nec Germanorum Regibus infinita aut libera poteſtas eſt; de minoribus rebus Principes conſultant, de ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joribus omnes. Rex aut Princeps auditur Authoritate ſuadendi, magis quam jubendi poteſtate; ſi diſplicuit ſententia, fremitu a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpernantur.</hi> Neither is the Power of the German Kings altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther free or unbounded. Matters of leſſer Moment are left to the Advice of the Princes, but thoſe of greater Concern are debated by the whole Society; they hear the King as one having Authority to perſuade, rather than any Power to command them; and if his Sentiments diſpleaſe them, they are rejected with boldneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caeſar</hi> gives us much the ſame portraicture of the Kings of the <hi>Gauls.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that their Succeſſors, who tore the Roman Empire to pieces, have retained this Form of a Limited Monarchy, is Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of inconteſtable Evidence, to every one that will take a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pains to peruſe the Hiſtories of thoſe Nations, to run over their Laws, and take notice how they have carried it towards their Kings when-ever they fell to Tyranny.</p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:55979:38"/>
                     <p>They who would be informed how far the Power of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thick Kings in <hi>Spain</hi> was limited, need only to caſt their Eyes upon the account which <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours</hi> gives us, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 31. concerning this Matter, and upon their Hiſtory in the Chronicle of St. <hi>Iſidorus.</hi> We have the fundamental Laws of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſet down by <hi>Molina, de Hiſpan. Primogenit. Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>N.</hi> 13.</p>
                     <p>But this appears yet more clearly from the Body of their Laws, which is ſtill extant, and publiſhed by <hi>Lindenberg.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt. It appears that their Laws were enacted, <hi>ex univerſali conſenſu Civium &amp; Populi,</hi> by the univerſal Conſent of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens and People, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Tit.</hi> 7.</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly, It appears that the Kings were no leſs obnoxious to the Laws, than the Subjects themſelves. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p n="3">3ly, It appears not that the Romans Laws, and much leſs their Royal Law, had any Authority amongſt them. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 9.</p>
                     <p n="4">4ly, It appears, that their Kings had not ſo much as the Power to pardon Crimes, without the conſent of the Biſhops, and chief Lords, <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Tit.</hi> 7.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, It is evident from their Hiſtory, that their Kings were liable to be depoſed by the States, when ever they went about to tranſgreſs their Bounds, and tyrannize over their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs, that the Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> IV. in their laſt Canon thus expreſs themſelves. <hi>Quicunque amodo ex nobis, vel totius Hiſpaniae populis, qualibet conjuratione vel ſtudio, ſacramentum fidei ſuae, quod pro Patriae Gentiſve Gothorum ſtatu, vel conſervatione Regiae ſalutis (vel incolumitate Regiae Poteſtatis) pollicitus eſt, teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raverit, aut poteſtate Regni exuerit, aut praeſumptione Tyrannicâ Regni faſtigium occupaverit, Anathema in conſpectu Dei Patris &amp; Angelorum, atque ab Eccleſia Catholica, quam perjurio profanaverit, efficiatur extraneus, &amp; ab omni Coetu Chriſtianorum alienus, cum omnibus impietatis ſuae fociis: quia oportet ut una poena teneat obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ios, quos ſimilis error invenerit implicatos.</hi> Whoſoever from this time forwards, either of us, or of any of the People of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſhall by any Conſpiracy or Attempt, break the Oath of his Fidelity he has taken for the welfare of his Country, and the Gothick Nation, the conſervation of the King's Life, and maintenance of the Royal Power; or who ſhall deprive him of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55979:39"/> his Kingdom, or by a Tyrannical Preſumption uſurp the Throne, let him be <hi>Anathema</hi> in the ſight of God the Father, and the Angels, and be caſt out from the Catholick Church, which he has profaned by his Perjury, and be turn'd out of all Chriſtian Aſſemblies, with all the Complices and Aſſociates of his Wickedneſs: becauſe it is but fit, that all they ſhould be lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſame Puniſhment, who are involved in the ſame Crime. The ſame is repeated in the Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> V. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. and in the Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> X. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. But we may affirm with truth, that thoſe who have worn this Canon threadbare by their frequent citing of it, did either not underſtand it, or changed the ſenſe of it to impoſe upon and delude others.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore let thoſe that read theſe words well obſerve;</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt. The Order which the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> IV. obſerve in ſpeaking of Oaths, <hi>Sacramentum fidei ſuae, quod pro Patriae, Gentiſque Gothorum ſtatu, vel conſervatione Regiae ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutis (vel incolumitate Regiae poteſtatis) pollicitus eſt.</hi> I own it is to be conſidered that the <hi>[vel]</hi> here ſignifies as much as <hi>[&amp;],</hi> this being the common ſtile of thoſe Times. I ſay it is remarkable, that the good and happy State of the Nation, was the firſt Object of their Oaths, the ſecond Object was join'd with it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Conſervation of the King, yet with the underſtood <hi>Proviſo,</hi> if he did not oppoſe the firſt, but was ſubſervient to it. For indeed, I cannot believe that God made the <hi>Goths</hi> of another nature than the reſt of Mankind, or ſo much Fools (enough) as to prefer the Means before the End; and to believe that they ought to engage themſelves to ſeek the Means, any further than they are of uſe to obtain the End. <hi>Ad Tutelam Legis Subditorum Rex creatus eſt.</hi> The King, ſaith Chancellor <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> is made for a Safeguard to the Subjects Laws. The Preſervation of the Subject is the firſt Obligation, and the next that of the Prince.</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly, We muſt obſerve, that the words of the Canon regard thoſe, who by a Conſpiracy undertake either to kill the King, or to deprive him of his Kingdom, or to uſurp the Throne by a Tyrannical Preſumption. But all this while they ſuppoſe a lawful King, that is to ſay, a King acknowledged as ſuch by the State, attack'd by ſome furious Conſpirators, with deſign to dethrone him, againſt all Right and Juſtice, for to place another in his ſtead. The Council does not in the leaſt ſuppoſe that it is unlawful for the State to deprive a Tyrant of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55979:39"/> Authority he abuſeth. If we ſuppoſe the contrary, we muſt take St. <hi>Iſidore,</hi> who was Preſident of that Council, for a Fool, fit to be ſhut up in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> for he expreſly makes this Obſervation, that <hi>Rex à rectè agendo vocatur; ſi enim piè &amp; juſtè &amp; miſericor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diter agit, merito Rex appellatur: ſi his caruerit, non Rex ſed Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus eſt.</hi> Addit 2 ad Cap. Caroli Magni, c. 21.</p>
                     <p n="3">3ly, I maintain that of all the Paſſages of Antiquity which are alledged by the Defenders of Paſſive Obedience, there is not any to be found which they ought to have been more careful to ſuppreſs in ſilence, than that of this Council. And we muſt judg them poſſeſs'd with a brutal Stupidity, or guilty of ſtrange Malice, in employing ſuch a Paſſage as this to ſupport their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices in favour of thoſe Princes who overturn the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For who were theſe Fathers of the 4th Council of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo?</hi> They were the very Men, who three Years before this Council, had caſt off <hi>Suinthila,</hi> after he had reign'd ten Years over them; who had raiſed <hi>Siſinandus</hi> in his room, againſt whom they juſtly feared that ſome furious Fellows might hatch a Conſpiracy. They were the Men who pronounced three <hi>Anathema's</hi> againſt <hi>Suinthila</hi> for the Crimes he had been found guilty of, whilſt he was poſſeſt of the Royal Power. They were the Men who declar'd, That if a King does not well acquit himſelf of the high Charge he is entruſted with, he ought to be excommunicated, and conſequently depriv'd of all Power in his Kingdom. All which is contain'd in <hi>Chap.</hi> 75. of the ſame Council, where they obſerve, that the Election of Kings took place after the Death of their Fathers. Which makes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that there is no ground at all to ſuſpect the <hi>Goths,</hi> or the Biſhops of <hi>Spain</hi> and of <hi>Gallia Narbonenſis,</hi> who aſſiſted at that Council, to have eſpous'd the Maximes that ſome would fix upon them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lombards</hi> obſerved the ſame Rules in their Government, as we may ſee in their Hiſtory written by <hi>Paulus Diaconus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as for what the other Kingdoms that were formed of the Ruines of the Empire of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, we find that their Power was always limited in the ſame manner, none of thoſe Princes having ever thought of reviving the Royal Law of the Ancient Roman Emperors in favour of themſelves.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe this Affair bears ſo great a reſemblance with the preſent Revolution, I deſire the Reader not to take it ill, that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55979:40"/> I have copied the 75th Canon of the 4th Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> at the end of theſe Remarks, and that he may make his Reflections thereupon: for he will find that thoſe who make uſe of it, have no reaſon to complain, That they who have made choice of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> upon the deſertion of <hi>James</hi> II, after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unjuſt Proceedings and Enterprizes, tending to the total overthrow of the State and Government, have exactly followed this Example of the Kingdom of <hi>Spain;</hi> and that the Clergy who have followed theſe Deciſions of State, have therein imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the Conduct of this Council of <hi>Toledo;</hi> and that thoſe who oppoſe themſelves againſt it, are found in the ſame Caſe with thoſe whom the Church of <hi>Spain</hi> and of <hi>Gallia Narbonen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> did ſo ſolemnly excommunicate.</p>
                     <p>The Kings of <hi>Burgundy</hi> reigned with the ſame Limitations: For which we may conſult the Law of <hi>Gondebaud,</hi> which is ſtill extant, and which was made, <hi>Habito Conſilio Comitum &amp; Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> with the Advice of the Earls and Lords, who ſigned the Law as well as King <hi>Gondebaud:</hi> which makes it very evident that the Kings of this People had not the Legiſlative Power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted in them alone. We find the ſame Clauſe in the ſecond Addition to that Law. And indeed we need only to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what <hi>Marius Aventicenſis</hi> relates concerning King <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> in his Chronicle, to enable us to judg that thoſe People had other Laws beſides that of the Will of their Princes. For this Prince having caus'd his Son to be ſtrangled without any Form of Juſtice, his Subjects conceived ſo great an Indignation againſt him, that he was forced to hide himſelf, and to take upon him a Fryars Habit, for a Mark of his Repentance, which yet was not able to give them Satisfaction, for as ſoon as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, they delivered him to <hi>Clodomer</hi> King of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who carried him to <hi>France,</hi> where ſoon after he loſt his Life in a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical manner.</p>
                     <p>We find Inſtances of the ſharing of the Soveraign Power between the Lords and the King in the Ancient Hiſtories of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> as may be ſeen in <hi>Joan. Magnus, Hiſt. lib.</hi> 15, &amp; 29. and in <hi>Crantzius, lib.</hi> 5. We find alſo that by the Oaths taken at the Coronation of their Kings, the Biſhops, Nobles, Citizens and People oblige themſelves, in caſe the King commit any thing by himſelf, or by another, contrary to the Articles or Treaty he ſwears to at his Coronation, to oppoſe themſelves to his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55979:40"/> upon their Honour, and upon their Oath, <hi>Chytraeus, lib.</hi> 2. They who do not know the Manner of the States of <hi>Sweden</hi> depoſing of <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> and the Reaſons they alledged for it to King <hi>James,</hi> may peruſe the Relation of it in <hi>Goldaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We find the ſame Limitations of the Regal Power in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> as <hi>Pontanus</hi> obſerves in his 8th Book; and it was for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to break through theſe Bounds, that <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> the II. was depoſed, as may be ſeen in <hi>Peterſen,</hi> in <hi>Chron. Holſat.</hi> Where he hath ſet down the Acts and Reaſons of the State of <hi>Denmark</hi> about that Proceeding.</p>
                     <p>That the Power of the Kings of <hi>Hungary,</hi> was a Power li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by the Fundamental Laws of the State, is a Matter ſo notorious, that <hi>Chalcondilas</hi> has made it his Obſervation, in the ſecond Book of his Hiſtory, where he compares the Royalty of <hi>Hungary</hi> in that reſpect to the Kingly Power in <hi>England.</hi> And which may be farther made out by the Fundamental Laws of <hi>Hungary,</hi> ſet down by <hi>Bonfinius, Decad.</hi> 4. <hi>lib.</hi> 9. Where we alſo find the Oath taken by thoſe Kings at their Coronation, being the moſt expreſly conditional that can be imagined.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Chalcondile</hi> ſaith the ſame Thing of the Kingdoms of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Navarre,</hi> Lib. 5. where he obſerves, that the Kings did not create the Magiſtrates, that they could not make any Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon without the Conſent of the People, and that they could not require any thing of them, contrary to their Cuſtoms, that is to ſay, contrary to their Laws. Accordingly we find that the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> have no Power to lay any new Impoſitions upon their Subjects without their conſent. They are obliged to ſwear they will obſerve the Laws. And in <hi>Arragon</hi> the People declare to the King at his Coronation, that if they do not perform their Oath and Promiſe, their Subjects are thereby ſet free from their Oath of Allegiance.</p>
                     <p>We find the ſame Thing in the Hiſtory of the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> but eſpecially in that part of it which gives an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Reign of <hi>Alphonſus</hi> III. The Fundamental Laws of which Kingdom we find in the 17th Title of the Ordinances of <hi>Portugal,</hi> Lib. 2. §. 2, 3. <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So true is it that all thoſe Kingdoms never in the leaſt ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that their King had an Abſolute Power over them. And it is as certain, that almoſt all thoſe States have always
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55979:41"/> maintained, That the Power of their Soveraigns was ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That they could make no Laws without the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That they could not levy any Mony on their Subjects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Conſents.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That they could not break the Laws according to their Will and Pleaſure.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That in caſe of their violating the Fundamental Laws of the State, they were liable to be deprived of a Power which they abuſed.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That the States were free to chuſe ſuch a Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and ſuch a Perſon for to govern them, as they thought moſt expedient for them.</p>
                     <p>This is that which I intend to prove more particularly by Examples taken from the Empire, and the Kingdoms of <hi>Poland, France, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> to which I ſhall add ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon thoſe Titles which deceive ſome, who conſider Things of this Nature with too little attention.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> That the Power of the Emperors of the Weſt, is a Limited Power.</head>
                     <p>THis is a Matter that may be eaſily gathered from theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Inſtances:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> who was the firſt that took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the Title of <hi>Roman Emperor,</hi> reigned according to the Cuſtoms of the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> of whoſe Opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Abſolute and Deſpotical Government, <hi>Tacitus</hi> has given us ſome Account, who repreſents them, as having the greateſt abhorrence for it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe <hi>Lewis the Good,</hi> did himſelf acknowledg, that the Soveraign Power was ſhared between him and the chief Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Empire; <hi>Capitular.</hi> Lib. 2. Tit. 3. <hi>Sed quanquam ſumma hujus miniſterii in noſtra perſona conſiſtere videatur, tamen &amp; Divinâ Authoritate, &amp; humanâ ordinatione, ita per partes divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum eſſe cognoſcitur, ut unuſquiſque veſtrûm in ſuo loco &amp; ordine, partem noſtri Miniſterii habere cognoſcatur.</hi> But though the whole of this Miniſtry ſeem to conſiſt in our Perſon, yet it is known to be ſo ſhared and divided, as well by Divine Authority, as Humane Ordination, that every one of you in his reſpective Place and Order, is known to partake of this Miniſtry. Thus was he pleaſed to expreſs himſelf in the Aſſembly of the States General, whoſe Authority he owned to be as much of Divine Right as his own; which made <hi>Charles du Moulin,</hi> the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous of all French Lawyers, ſay, <hi>Ergo ſolum Caput non omnia poteſt, imo perſona Principis non eſt Caput niſi Organicum, ſed verum Caput eſt Principatus ipſe, cum membris integrantibus eum;</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Head alone cannot do all, yea, the Perſon of the Prince is only the Organical Head, but the true Head is the Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it ſelf, with its integral conſtituting Members. Which are his expreſs words in his Commentaries upon the Stile of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, dedicated to the firſt Preſident of <hi>Paris,</hi> and printed with Priviledg.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:55979:42"/>3. Becauſe though the Weſtern Empire did ſeem to be ſo He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary, that the Emperors had divided it amongſt their Children; yet, in proceſs of time, it became Elective, which began to take place in the Eleventh Century, in the Perſon of <hi>Rudolphus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. In that they always excluded Females from the Succeſſion to the Empire, though they had reſpect in their choice to the Imperial Blood.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to the Rights of Soveraignty we find, that tho the Empire be a Monarchical Government, yet we ſee it is mixed with Ariſtocracy; for the Emperor cannot enjoy it, but with the Conſent of the States of the Empire, without making himſelf liable to be contradicted and depoſed alſo.</p>
                     <p>He has not the Right of making Laws, without the Conſent and Authority of the States of the Empire.</p>
                     <p>He has no right to declare War, without the foregoing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the States.</p>
                     <p>He has no right of levying any Impoſition on the States, without the Conſent of the Diets.</p>
                     <p>Whenever he begins to uſurp the Rights that do not belong unto him, and to infringe the Rules of Government he has ſworn to obſerve, the States have a Right to oppoſe his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, to repel Force with Force, and finally to deprive him of the Empire, in caſe he continue in the Deſign of changing the Form of Government. For though there be no Laws, which bound and regulate the Article of the Depoſing of Emperors, when they abuſe their Power for the overturning of the State, or for invading the Rights of the Princes of the Empire, and Imperial Cities; yet the Germans have always held, and ſtill do hold it for a certain Truth, that it is a Right inherent in the Empire, to deprive an Emperor of the Imperial Power and Dignity, and to confer the ſame on another. This is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Opinion of the German Lawyers repreſented to us by <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padius, Arnizaeus, Diderick, Conringe,</hi> and many others.</p>
                     <p>And indeed we may ſay, that there is nothing more certain, if we conſider the Examples of Emperors that have been depoſed ſince theſe 7 or 800 Years; Examples that are neither rare nor unknown, and upon occaſion of which the States of the Empire have had an opportunity to declare &amp; make out their Rights and Pretenſions. One of the firſt Examples we find reſpecting this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55979:42"/> is the Depoſition of <hi>Lewis the Good,</hi> in the Year 833. The Acts whereof we may ſee in <hi>Baronius, Goldaſt, du Cheſne,</hi> and <hi>le Comte;</hi> Whereupon we may make theſe Reflections; 1. That the Thing was done with the Conſent of the Biſhops, and of all the Nobility. 2. That the Eſtates above all accuſe him for having broke his Coronation-Oath. 3. That though this <hi>Lewis</hi> was afterwards reſtored to the Throne of the Empire, yet thoſe that reſtored him, never conteſted the Power the State had to reject a Prince, who overturn'd the Rules of Government, but ſuppoſed only that he had not been duly convinced of the Crimes laid to his charge.</p>
                     <p>We have another Example, in the Depoſition of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. The Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Dukes and Earls, declare, that they had not ſworn to him, till after he had engaged himſelf by his Oath to them, to obſerve the Laws and the Capitulations of the Empire: ſo that having now violated them, they were ſet free from the Oath they had ſworn to him, and that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered him as an Enemy, againſt whom they would wage war to their laſt breath. <hi>Lambert Schafnaburg.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One of the laſt Inſtances we find in the depoſing of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Wenceſlaus,</hi> who was depoſed by the Electors of the Empire in the Year 1400, after that he had been twice taken Priſoner, and had been exhorted by the State, to amend and take up from his irregular Actings. <hi>Aventin. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Annalium &amp; Cuſpinian. in Vita Venceſlai.</hi> We may ſee the moſt part of theſe Articles, and many more ſolidly confirmed in the Book of <hi>Carpſovius, de Lege Regia Imperatorum Germaniae,</hi> and in the Imperial Capitulations, and other Laws, which he has cauſed to be printed at the End of his Treatiſe.</p>

                        <hi>Poland,</hi> from the Relation of <hi>Cromer,</hi> gives us an illuſtrious Example of the Wiſdom of Northern People, in bounding the Power of their Princes. After that the Family of <hi>Lech,</hi> the firſt Founder of that Kingdom, was extinct, that State changed the Royal Government, into that of XII <hi>Waywods,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Palatines.</hi> Theſe Palatines abuſing their Authority, they re-eſtabliſhed the Regal Government, in favor of <hi>Cracus,</hi> whoſe ſecond Son was expell'd by the <hi>Polanders</hi> for killing his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brother.</p>
                     <p>They afterwards choſe the Daughter of <hi>Cracus</hi> for their Queen, who, 'tis ſaid, having drowned her ſelf to avoid Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, the <hi>Polanders</hi> again eſtabliſhed 12 <hi>Palatines,</hi> as they had done before: but afterwards ſuppreſſed them again, becauſe they found them inſufficient to defend the Countrey, and choſe <hi>Premiel</hi> for their King.

                     <p>His Succeſſors having reigned until <hi>Lesko</hi> Surnamed the <hi>Black,</hi> who was forced by Flight to quit the Kingdom, becauſe he was not able to reſiſt the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and died without Iſſue: the Poles wearied with inteſtine Wars, excited by the Ambition of their great Lords, choſe <hi>Premiel</hi> to be their King, who being kill'd, without leaving any Children behind him, they made choice of

                        <hi>Ladiſlaus,</hi> who was afterwards deſpoſed, for Male-Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the States General. <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who had been choſen in his ſtead, dying in the Year 1305, <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> was recall'd to the Government, to whom <hi>Caſimir</hi> his Son ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; who in the Year 1370 deſigned for his Succeſſor, with conſent of the States, <hi>Lewis,</hi> the Son of <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> by his Siſter. The <hi>Poles</hi> after the Death of <hi>Lewis,</hi> choſe <hi>Edwiga</hi> his Daughter, upon condition that ſhe ſhould marry the Perſon whom the States ſhould recommend to her for a Husband; the Perſon recommended by them was <hi>Jagello</hi> Duke of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> who had the name of <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> given him by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Gneſna,</hi> who anointed and Crowned, after he had firſt baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. He outliv'd <hi>Edwiga</hi> who died without Children, and had for Succeſſors the children of his fourth Wife, who reached until <hi>Sigiſmund Auguſtus,</hi> after whoſe Death the States choſe in the Year 1573 <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> who after he had reigned four Months in <hi>Poland,</hi> abandon'd the Kingdom, to take poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and was deprived of that of <hi>Poland,</hi> by the States, as may be ſeen from the Acts recorded by Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. This Vacancy occaſion'd a Diviſion in the States, one part of them having choſen the Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Second; and the other part <hi>Anne</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Sigismund Auguſtus,</hi> to whom they gave <hi>Stephen Battori</hi> Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> for her husband, who Married the ſaid <hi>Anne,</hi> and was Crowned at <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covia</hi> in 1576. After the Death of <hi>Stephen,</hi> the States choſe <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmund,</hi> Son of <hi>John</hi> III King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and of <hi>Katharine</hi> Daughter of <hi>Sigismund</hi> I. of that name, King of <hi>Poland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is evident from this Abridgment, 1ſt. That the <hi>Poles</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways pretended to be the Maſters that had right to give the Form to their State, which ſeemed to them moſt comporting with the Good and Welfare of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly, That they took it for granted that they had Power to reject thoſe Princes or <hi>Palatines,</hi> whoſe Behaviour was contrary to the Publick Good, for which they had raiſed them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3ly, That they ever had an Eye to Succeſſion, ſo far as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow the Crown ſometimes upon Daughters, yet not thinking themſelves bound to it, but only ſo far as the good of the State did permit.</p>

                     <p n="5">5ly, That the Flight or Deſertion of their Kings, has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to them a ſufficient Ground to proceed to a new Election, in their ſtead, and to reject them. This is evident from the Hiſtory of <hi>Lesko,</hi> ſurnamed the <hi>Black,</hi> and of <hi>Henry</hi> the III of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6ly, That the anointing and Crowning of their Kings, was of no avail to diſpenſe with their Oath in which they publickly declare, That if they do not obſerve the Laws of the State, the People are diſpenſed from their Oaths of Fealty they have ſworn to them.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> That the Monarchy of <hi>France</hi> is not an Abſolute Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, but a Limited Royalty.</head>
                     <p>'TIS not of to day only, that ſome have imagined the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of <hi>France,</hi> to be an unlimited Power, and an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Empire: <hi>Bodinus</hi> was of that opinion before them; but they that follow his ſentiment, underſtand nothing of that Conſtitution: or if they do, have a greater deſire to flatter the unjuſt Pretenſions of that Court, than to maintain the Truth.</p>
                     <p>We need only to lay open the nature and antient Power of the States General, with the manner of their Behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe Kings, who abuſed the Power committed to them, to make it evident, that the French Monarchy is limited in its Conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>Under the firſt and ſecond Race of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> there was no mention of any Aſſembly of the States General, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Franks,</hi> that is to ſay, the Nobles and Prelats, who were uſed to meet together, on the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> in the open Field, where they deliberated with the King, concerning mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Peace and War, and took Reſolutions of what was to be done all the Year after. After the breaking up of this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55979:44"/> the Court of the Royal Palace, otherwiſe called the Court of <hi>France,</hi> compoſed of the Prelats and Great Barons, that is to ſay, the immediate Vaſſals of the Crown, met together five or ſix times a Year to take care of the Execution of what had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd upon in the General Aſſembly, to deliberate about pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs that offer'd themſelves, and to determine as Judges the moſt important matters of private Perſons.</p>
                     <p>Under the declination of the 2d Race, the Governours of Cities and Provinces, having made themſelves Hereditary Lords of the places of their reſpective Governments, under the Title of Counties and Dutchies, cut themſelves large Portions out of the Soveraign's Lands: by which means the Court of <hi>France</hi> was no more frequented by the Lords, except only, when they were obliged to do Hommage, and take the Oath of Fidelity, or when an Enemy invaded <hi>France:</hi> for then they preſented themſelves before the King, to adviſe about the preſent neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This Diſorder continued until the Reign of <hi>Philip Auguſtus,</hi> who having conquer'd <hi>Normandy,</hi> and the Counties of <hi>Tourain, Anjou, Maine,</hi> from <hi>John without Land, King of England,</hi> and the Country of <hi>Vermandois</hi> from the Earl of <hi>Flanders;</hi> reſtored in ſome manner the Royal Authority, and forced the Barons to frequent his Court, and to be preſent at the Aſſemblies he called for the Affairs and Neceſſities of State. Nevertheleſs thoſe Aſſemblies conſiſted only of the Prelats and Barons, and this till the Reign of King <hi>John</hi> (ſome Authors ſay of St. <hi>Lewis</hi>) who being taken at the Battle of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> and carried to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> they were forc'd to raiſe a great Sum of Money for his Ranſom; and to this End they appli'd themſelves to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and other Inhabitants of Cities, who were then the richeſt Men of the Kingdom, who agreed to pay the King's Ranſom, upon condition that they might be received into the Charges and Offices, as well of Peace as of War, and be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have a Place and deliberative Voice in the States-General, which was accordingly granted to them.</p>
                     <p>The Power and Prerogative of the States-General was ſuch, that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> could not make any new Levies of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny without them. Which continued ſo till the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi>
                        <pb n="70" facs="tcp:55979:45"/> VII. as is acknowledged by <hi>Philip de Commines Lib.</hi> 6 <hi>c.</hi> 7. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could they make any new Ordinances, nor repeal or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the old, without the conſent of the ſaid States, as is own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Davila lib.</hi> 2 <hi>de li Guerri Civili.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Under the Firſt, and ſecond Race of the French Kings, the Ordinances were likewiſe made in the Aſſembly of the Prelats, and Barons, which conſtituted the Soveraign Court of <hi>France;</hi> 'twas there the Treaties of Peace were made between the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and Foreign Princes, and Nations; the Portions of the Children of <hi>France</hi> were there regulated; there they treated of their Marriages, and generally of all that concern'd the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of State, of the King's Houſhold, and the Children of <hi>France.</hi> The Ordinances that were made in the ſaid Aſſemblies, in the Name of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> were conceived in theſe Terms; <hi>Nos de conſilio &amp; conſenſu Procerum noſtrorum ſtatuimus,</hi> &amp;c. We with the Advice and Conſent of our Lords do ordain. And from hence is derived the Cuſtome obſerved at this Day, of verifying the Royal Edicts in the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> which in ſome ſort repreſents the Aſſembly of the Prelats and Barons, who compoſed, as we have ſaid, the Soveraign Court of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Treaſury of the French Kings, at <hi>Chartres,</hi> are found ſeveral Treaties between King <hi>Philip Auguſtus,</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>John without Land,</hi> Kings of <hi>England,</hi> at the bottom of which are the Seals of the Prelats and Barons; by whoſe Conſent and Approbation the ſaid Treaties had been made. And Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> VI having ſent to entreat St. <hi>Lewis</hi> that he would be pleas'd to permit him to retire into <hi>France,</hi> to ſecure himſelf from the attempts of <hi>Frederick</hi> II. the ſaid King anſwered the Popes Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio, that he would communicate the Matter to his Parliament, without whoſe Conſent the Kings of <hi>France</hi> could do nothing of Importance. This is related by <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> in the Life of <hi>Henry</hi> the III. King of <hi>England, ad Annum</hi> 1244.</p>
                     <p>We find alſo the manner how the States determined all Affairs reſpecting the Crown and Succeſſion, as for Example the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs which was between <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> and King <hi>Edward.</hi> In this Aſſembly of the States, ſaith the Chancellor <hi>de l' Hoſpital,</hi> was Tried and Debated the moſt Noble Cauſe that ever was, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:55979:45"/> To whom the Crown of <hi>France</hi> did belong, after the Death of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fair, to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Valois</hi> his Couſin, or to <hi>Edward</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> King <hi>Philip</hi> not preſiding in that Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, becauſe he was not yet King, and beſides was a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p>It appears clearly from the Power of the States General, That the Power of the King of <hi>France</hi> is bounded by Law; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this is a Truth whereof we cannot make the leaſt doubt, foraſmuch as we find it acknowledged by <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled Monarch that ever was. See what he writes in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary of War, compoſed by him a little before his Death, for the uſe of <hi>Charles</hi> VIII. his Son. <q>When Kings or Princes, (ſaith he) have no reſpect to the Law, they take from the People, what they ought to leave them poſſeſt of, and do not give them what they ought to have; and in ſo doing they make their People Slaves, and thereby loſe the name of a King. For no body can be called a King, but he that rules and has Dominion over Free-men.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This thing was ſo notorious even to Strangers themſelves, that <hi>Machiavel</hi> maintained that the Stability of the Monarchy of <hi>France,</hi> was owing to this, becauſe the Kings there were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to a great number of Laws, which proved the Security and Safe-guard of all their Subjects. <hi>Lib.</hi> 1 <hi>di Diſcorſi c.</hi> 16.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Meſſire Claudius de Seiſſel,</hi> in his Treatiſe of the French Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, <hi>part</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 12. dedicated to <hi>Francis</hi> I. maintains upon this account, That the Monarchy of <hi>France</hi> does partake of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocraſy, which makes it both more perfect and durable. Yea he aſſerts that it was alſo in part Democratical, and expreſly maintains that an abſolute Monarchy is no other than true Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, when it is made uſe of againſt Religion, Juſtice and the Government; That a Prince who paſſeth theſe Bounds, muſt be held and eſteemed for a wicked Tyrant, cruel and intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who by this means pulls down the Hatred of God and his Subjects upon himſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Du Haillan Hiſtoriographer</hi> of the Kings <hi>Henry</hi> III and <hi>Henry</hi> IV. follows the ſame notion of <hi>Claudius de Seiſſel,</hi> in his third Book of the ſtate of the Affairs of <hi>France,</hi> dedicated to <hi>Henry</hi>
                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:55979:46"/> III. maintaining that the Government of <hi>France</hi> is compoſed of Ariſtocraſy and Democraſy, <hi>p.</hi> 168.</p>
                     <p>And indeed who can judg otherwiſe, when he attentively conſiders theſe ſix things, which are a part of the publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt. That though the Crown for a long time ſince has fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the form of Succeſſion, yet the form of Election is ſtill obſerved at the Coronation. <hi>Hunc vultis, hunc jubetis eſſe Regem,</hi> This is he whom you will and require to be your King; theſe Words are ſpoken to the People before the Coronation. We find the Peoples Election is mentioned, and the King called elect in the form of Coronation, publiſhed by <hi>Hugo Menard</hi> a <hi>Benedictin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2ly. The King is there engaged by his Oath, to rule accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Laws of the Kingdom; as may be ſeen in the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3ly. He can make no Laws but in the Parliaments or States General; whereof we have an Inſtance in the States of <hi>Orleans,</hi> in the Year 1560. and is the ſame with what <hi>D'avila</hi> has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his 2d Book of the Civil Wars.</p>
                     <p n="4">4ly. He can make neither Peace nor War but by the Advice of the States General. This is acknowledg'd by <hi>Lewis</hi> XI as we find in <hi>Philip de Commines</hi> 2 <hi>Book ch.</hi> 14.</p>
                     <p n="5">5ly. He can raiſe no Mony but by Conceſſion from the States General. We find this point thus decided by the States of 1338, with the conſent of King <hi>Philip,</hi> That no Taxes could be impoſed or levied on the People of <hi>France,</hi> without urgent and evident Neceſſity did require it, and then only by the grant of the States. <hi>Gila Fol.</hi> 157. <hi>Philip de Commines, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 18. ſaith, with reſpect to this point: <q>Is there any King or Lord on the Earth, who has Power, beſides his Demeſne, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſo much as a Penny upon his Subjects, without the Grant and Conſent of thoſe who are to pay it, except it be by Tyranny and Violence?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6ly. The Kings of <hi>France</hi> are liable to be depoſed by the States General, in caſe they abuſe the Authority they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with.</p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:55979:46"/>
                     <p>This laſt Article, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Proceedings of the French againſt thoſe of their Kings, who abuſed their Authority, does evidently demonſtate, That the Monarchy of <hi>France</hi> is altogether limited, according to the Platform <hi>Caeſar</hi> gives us of the Government of the ancient Germans or <hi>Francs,</hi> who are deſcended from them. There is a paſſage, which is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily abuſed, to prove that unjuſt Kings and Tyrants cannot be depoſed, wherein <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours</hi> thus expreſſeth himſelf, to <hi>Chilperic Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 19. <q>If any one of us who are Lords transgreſſeth the Bounds of Juſtice, you have the Power to puniſh him; but if you your ſelf do not keep within them, who is it can correct you? We indeed ſpeak to you, and you hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to us, if you pleaſe, and if you will not, who is it ſhall condemn you? except he who has ſaid, that he is Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it ſelf.</q> I don't believe there was ever any Author, that undertook to defend the Doctrine of Non-reſiſtance and Paſſive Obedience, who has not made uſe of this Proof: but give me leave to ſay, that they have quoted this paſſage with as much Judgment as they alledged the 75th Canon of the 4th Council of <hi>Toledo:</hi> for 1ſt. Obſerve that this is the Diſcourſe of <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of <hi>Tours,</hi> who was accuſed by <hi>Chilperic,</hi> for oppoſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Juſtice that Prince demanded of a Council, againſt <hi>Pretextat</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Roven,</hi> whom he accuſed of high Treaſon, and forasmuch as the Biſhops were perſwaded of his Innocence, whom they ſaw attackt by falſe Witneſſes, this <hi>Gregory</hi> had the Courage, to maintain that it was their Duty to make their Remonſtrances to the King concerning this matter. The King took their Deſign of remonſtrancing him for an oppoſition to the Juſtice he had demanded; whereupon <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours</hi> made the Diſcourſe juſt now mentioned. So that it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears; that this Diſcourſe only reſpects the order of Biſhops, who under that Relation, have no other way to redreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with regard to Kings, but only by Remonſtrances, but does not at all ſpeak of the Body of the State, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with other Rights, in Reference to a King who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to pervert Juſtice. But to make it appear that French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, at that time, did not believe, that Kings had the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that they could not be depoſed by the States: Though
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55979:47"/> they abuſed their Authority, we need only to conſult the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the depoſing of <hi>Childeric,</hi> Father of <hi>Clovis,</hi> which is ſet down by <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>ch.</hi> 11. and approved of by him.</p>
                     <p>We find that they had preſerved this their Right by the Depoſition of another <hi>Childeric</hi> in the 8th Century, and whereupon it is obvious and natural to make theſe Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Francs</hi> had the Power of chooſing and depoſing their Kings.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the Oath they ſwore to their Kings was conditional, and ſuppoſed their acquitting themſelves of the charge and truſt repoſed in them, and which they were obliged by Oath to make good.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That it is falſe that King <hi>Childeric</hi> was depoſed by the Authority of Pope <hi>Zachary,</hi> as the Papiſts have maintained; foraſmuch as that proceeding was an Act of the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, who made uſe of their Right on this occaſion.</p>
                     <p>This is ſo true, that Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> himſelf laid it down as a Maxim in his Letter to the <hi>Francs,</hi> that this was a right inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the People. <hi>Nam ſi Princeps Populo, cujus beneficio Regnum poſſidet, obnoxius eſt; ſi Plebs Regem conſtituit, &amp; deſtituere poteſt:</hi> For if a King, ſaith he, be obnoxious to his People, by whoſe graunt he poſſeſſeth his Kingdom; if the People conſtitute a King, they may alſo depoſe him.</p>
                     <p>If we come to the Race of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, we find <hi>Lewis</hi> the Good depoſed by the States aſſembled at <hi>Thionville.</hi> The whole Proceeding whereof may be ſeen in <hi>Baronius, du Cheſne Le Cointe,</hi> where we may obſerve 1. That it was done with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Biſhops. 2. We ſee there an Indictment on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Articles, which contains as many Crimes againſt the State. 3. When this Depoſition was recalled afterwards, they did annul the Acts of the former Aſſembly, not as if they had acted without Power, but becauſe they had proceeded on falſe Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, and inſufficient Grounds. We find alſo the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding with reſpect of <hi>Charles</hi> the Groſs, and <hi>Charles</hi> the Simple.</p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:55979:47"/>
                     <p>Indeed it was then ſo notorious, that the Power of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> though they took to themſelves the Title of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, was limited, the Eſtates being inveſted with part of the Soveraign Authority, that <hi>Lewis</hi> the Good ſolemnly avows the ſame, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Capitul. c.</hi> 2, &amp; <hi>c.</hi> 12. We find alſo that the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of <hi>France</hi> was ſo far convinced that the States of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom had right to diſpoſe of the Crown, for the good of the State, that when <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald was choſen by the Kingdom of <hi>Lorrain</hi> in Prejudice of the Children of the King his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> II. wrote to them thereupon by <hi>Hincmar</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Rheims,</hi> threatning to excommunicate them, they ſent back this Anſwer to him by the ſaid <hi>Hincmar: Petite Dominum Apoſtolicum, ut quia Rex &amp; Epiſcopus ſimul eſſe non poteſt, &amp; ſui Anteceſſores Eccleſiaſticum ordinem quod ſuum eſt, &amp; non Rempublicam, quod Regum eſt, diſpoſuerunt, non praecipiat nobis habere Regem, qui nos in ſic longinquis partibus adjuvare non poſſet contra ſubitaneos &amp; frequentes Paganorum impetus, &amp; nos Francos non jubeat ſervire, cui nolumus ſervire, quia iſtud jugum ſui Anteceſſores noſtris Anteceſſoribus non impoſuerunt, &amp; nos illud portare non poſſumus, qui ſcriptum eſſe in ſanctis libris audimus, ut pro libertate &amp; haereditate noſtra, uſque ad mortem certare debeamus.</hi> Deſire the Apoſtolical Lord, that forasmuch as he cannot be King and Biſhop both together, and that his Anceſtors have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned themſelves with the Eccleſiaſtical Order, which is their particular Province, and not with the Common-wealth, which is the Office of Kings, not to command us to take ſuch a one for our King, who at ſo great a diſtance, is not able to help us againſt the ſudden and frequent Aſſaults of Heathens, and to require us <hi>Francs</hi> to ſerve him, whom we will not ſerve, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Anceſtors never offer'd to impoſe this Yoke upon our Anceſtors, neither can we bear it, who find it written in the Holy Books, That we ought to fight for our Liberties and our Inheritance even unto Death.</p>
                     <p>We ſee alſo that he who was the Head of the Third Race, <hi>viz. Hugh Capet,</hi> was choſen King of <hi>France,</hi> notwithſtanding the apparent Rights of <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who was the next Heir of <hi>Lewis</hi> V. by reaſon that the ſaid <hi>Charles</hi> ſeemed too
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55979:48"/> much linked to the Intereſts of the <hi>Germans,</hi> who at that time were Enemies to <hi>France, Guil. de Nangis ad An.</hi> 987. and others in <hi>du Cheſne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Who does not know the Hiſtory of <hi>Henry</hi> III. who having been depoſed in <hi>Poland,</hi> for deſerting that Kingdom, was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards depoſed in <hi>France,</hi> by advice of the <hi>Sorbonn,</hi> and of the greateſt part of the States.</p>
                     <p>We may eaſily judg from theſe two Characters, that French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men never were infected with the Doctrine of Non-reſiſtance: The one is, becauſe they look'd upon this Doctrine as an Error. See what <hi>Gerſon</hi> the famous Chancellor of the Univerſity of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> ſaith of it; <hi>Error eſt dicere terrenum Principem in nullo, ſuis ſubditis, dominio durante, obligari; quia ſecundum jus Divinum &amp; Naturalem aequitatem, &amp; verum Dominii finem, quemadmodum ſubditi debent fidem, ſubſidium &amp; ſervitium Domino, ſic etiam Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus ſubditis ſuis fidem debet &amp; protectionem. Et ſi eos mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſte &amp; cum obſtinatione in injuria &amp; de facto proſequatur Princeps, tunc Regula haec Naturalis, vim vi repellere licet, locum habet. Opuſc. adverſus Adulat. conſid.</hi> 7. It is an Error, ſaith he, to aſſert, that an Earthly Prince, as long as his Dominion laſts, does not ſtand engaged to his Subjects in any thing; becauſe, according to the Divine Law, Natural Equity, and the true End of Dominion, as the Subjects owe to their Prince Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, Subſidy and Service, ſo their Prince owes them Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Protection; and in caſe he doth publickly and with obſtinacy imperiouſly oppreſs them, then that natural Rule takes place, That it is lawful to repel Force by Force.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, that they have always with horror rejected the Abuſe that has been made of the Expreſſion in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. <hi>Hoc eſt Jus Regis,</hi> for to maintain the Tyranny of Princes. <q>If we will believe the Laws amongſt you Princes, (ſaith <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius d' Epenſe</hi> to King <hi>Henry</hi> II.) you are Lord of our Body and Goods; or to ſpeak more like Chriſtians, we and ours are at your command. Your Majeſty ought to abhor that Right nothing leſs than Royal, and nothing more than Tyrannical, which God by the Mouth of <hi>Samuel</hi> did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to Kings, but only threatned the People with, telling them, This ſhall be the Right of the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55979:48"/> adds, Go to now ye Dogs and Flatterers of the Court, go to, and alledg hence-forward this Right, not Regal but Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but Turkiſh, but Scythian, or if any worſe Epithet can be invented.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I acknowledg that the Face of Affairs is very much changed ſince theſe hundred Years. The States General have not been aſſembled almoſt theſe Seventy Years. The Parliaments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which were eſtabliſhed by the Kings and the States General, to preſerve the Rights of the States, have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, by the preſent King, to verify without any Debate, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Edicts for the Impoſition of Mony. But yet after all, this Change is of ſo late ſtanding, that there is little appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance it ſhould be look'd upon as a ſufficient Preſcription a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Intereſt of the State. Thoſe French-men who have any knowledg of the Laws of the State, and its Conſtitution, ſet down the <hi>Epocha</hi> or Date of this Change of the Ancient Maxims of the Kingdom, to wit, the time which followed the Ceſſation of the Holding of the Eſtates General, or the Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII, and the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV.</p>
                     <p>Let no Body imagine that the Ancient <hi>Idea</hi> of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>France,</hi> is quite effaced out of the Spirit of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I own, that <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. by a Reign both very long and very violent, has made the <hi>French</hi> loſe a great deal of their Courage. The Clergy of that Kingdom have, above all, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſupport his Tyranny; by Maxims advanc'd and contriv'd by them for the ruin of the Proteſtants, with as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regard for their Country, as they have ſhewed Conſcience in their baſe Panegyricks pronounced to his Honour. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there are ſtill in being a great number of honeſt Men, who adhere to thoſe Ancient Maxims. I can at this preſent produce one of theſe from amongſt the Clergy, the Learned and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious <hi>M. Joly,</hi> Canon of the Church of <hi>Paris,</hi> who in the Year 1663, publiſh'd a Book, with this title, <hi>Important Maxims for the Education of a King.</hi> This Man alone may ſuffice to prove my aſſertion, for he very vigorouſly confirms theſe Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, by the Teſtimony of Kings themſelves, Chancellors, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55979:49"/> of State, Lawyers, and Hiſtorians of <hi>France,</hi> that they were always of Opinion in that Kingdom, That the King holds his Authority from the People; That the Power of Kings is Limited; That the French Monarchy is a Monarchy allay'd and temper'd with Ariſtocraſy and Democraſy; That the Kings can do nothing without the States General, which are the very ſame things, with our Parliaments; That the Judges are the Peoples Officers; That the words ſo much abuſed, <hi>Such is our Pleaſure,</hi> ſignify only, This is the Decree of our Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature: That they have no Right to levy any Impoſitions, without the Conſent of the States; and many other Articles of that Nature.</p>

                     <head>
                        <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> That the Royalty of <hi>England</hi> never had any other form than the reſt of the Northern and Weſtern States.</head>
                     <p>I Have inſiſted the longer to ſhew how the Royalty was limited in <hi>France,</hi> becauſe the moſt part of our Modern Writers, ſeem to have had in their aims to reduce our Monarchy to the Form of that Kingdom, as ſuppoſing that it would have been a moſt glorious and advantageous Thing for our late Kings, to transform them into ſo many <hi>Lewis</hi>'s XIV; that is to ſay, to change us into Slaves, and our Princes into Tyrants.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall ſay nothing of the Royalty in <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor of the Bounds have been always ſet it by the Fundamental Laws of the State. There has been lately ſo much writ concerning this Matter, to juſtify the Proceedings of the Convention of that Kingdom, that it would be of no uſe to repeat it here.</p>
                     <p>And for the ſame reaſon I ſhall excuſe my ſelf of the trouble of treating what concerns the Limitation of the Royalty in <hi>England</hi> ſo largely, as the Subject ſeems to deſerve: however what I ſhall ſay will be ſufficient to make it appear, that Royalty has been always on the ſame foot in that Kingdom, as it is ſtill in the other Weſtern Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p>If we conſider the moſt remote times that Hiſtory gives us any account of, we ſhall find that the <hi>Saxons,</hi> as to the Power of their Kings, followed the Example of the Ancient <hi>Germans,</hi> whoſe Authority, if we may believe <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> was altogether limited and reſtrain'd.</p>
                     <p>We find in the <hi>Mirror of Juſtices,</hi> cap. 1, 2. that the firſt <hi>Saxons</hi> created their Kings, that they made them take an Oath, and that they put them in mind that they were liable to be judged as well as their meaneſt Subjects.</p>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:55979:50"/>
                     <p>After that the Right of Succeſſion was received in <hi>England,</hi> yet it never deprived the Engliſh People of the Right of chooſing their Kings. This is evident from the Form of the Coronation publiſhed by <hi>Hugh Menard,</hi> at the end of the Book of Sacraments of St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> p. 278. which Form was as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. After they had made the King promiſe to preſerve the Laws and the Rights of the Church, we read theſe words: <hi>Deinde alloquantur duo Epiſcopi populum in Eccleſia, inquirentes eorum voluntatem, &amp; ſi concordes fuerint, agant gratias Deo Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potenti, decantantes Te Deum laudamus?</hi> 
                        <q>Then let two Biſhops ſpeak to the People in the Church, and demand their Will and Pleaſure, and in caſe they do agree, let them give thanks to Almighty God, ſinging, <hi>We praiſe thee, O Lord.</hi>
                        </q> And, <hi>pag.</hi> 269, &amp; 270, <q>We pray thee moſt humbly to multiply the gifts of thy Bleſſings, upon this thy Servant, whom we chuſe to be our King, <hi>viz.</hi> of all <hi>Albion</hi> and of the <hi>Franks.</hi>
                        </q> That the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are as well bound by their Oath, as their Subjects, appears by the confeſſion of <hi>Henry</hi> III, upon occaſion of one of his Councellors of State, pretending, that he was not obliged to preſerve the Liberties of the Nation, as being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from him, expreſſing himſelf in theſe terms recorded by <hi>Mat. Paris</hi> under the Year 1223. <hi>Omnes libertates illas juravimus, &amp; omnes adſtricti ſumus, ut quod juravimus obſervemus,</hi> pag. 219. All theſe Liberties we have ſworn to, and we are all bound to obſerve and make good what we have ſworn. Engliſh Men were always ſo well perſwaded of this Truth, that in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of <hi>Richard</hi> II, they thought they had done enough to prove, That the King had forſworn himſelf by the Oath he had taken, having broken ſeveral of the Articles he had promiſed to his Subjects by Oath to obſerve, as we may ſee in the Acts of his Depoſal recorded in the Chronicle of <hi>Knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>James</hi> the Firſt was convinced of this, when he told the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of 1609. the 21ſt of <hi>March,</hi> 
                        <q>That the King is bound by a double Oath, tacitly, as being King, and ſo bound to protect his People and the Laws, and expreſly by his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation Oath, ſo as every juſt King is bound to preſerve
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55979:50"/> that Paction made with his People by his Laws, framing the Government thereunto; and a King leaves to be a King, and degenerates into a Tyrant, as ſoon as he leaves off to govern by Law.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>For what concerns the Laws, we find that the Kings alone had not the Authority of making them. King <hi>Edwin</hi> publiſhed his Laws, <hi>Habito cum Sapientibus &amp; Senioribus Conſilio,</hi> with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Wiſe Men and Elders. <hi>Ina</hi> King of the Weſt Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did the like. The Laws of <hi>Alfrede</hi> were made after the ſame manner, <hi>Ex conſilio prudentiſſimorum, atque iis omnibus pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit edici eorum omnium Obſervationes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the Government of the State, we find that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments met, and that their Meetings were fix'd once a Year by <hi>Alfred;</hi> which was renewed by <hi>Edward</hi> II, by two Laws. Moreover the King was obliged to aſſiſt at them, in caſe he was not ſick; and nothing but his Sickneſs could diſpenſe with his Attendance.</p>
                     <p>That Engliſh-men never believed that the King of <hi>England</hi> could violate the Laws, and overturn the State at his Pleaſure, without making himſelf thereby liable to puniſhment, clearly appears from the Laws of St. <hi>Edward,</hi> and by the manner of holding Parliaments, confirmed by <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, and printed by the care of <hi>Dom. Luc. D'achery,</hi> in the 12 To me of his <hi>Spicilege.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sure it is, that we clearly find theſe three things, 1ſt. That by the Agreement and Conſent of King <hi>John,</hi> upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints made againſt him by the whole State, there were choſen 25 Barons, with Power to repreſent to the King his unjuſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Nation, and to oblige him by force of Arms to redreſs them, which he himſelf publiſhed by his Letters Patents in the Year 1215. which piece was publiſhed by <hi>Dom. Luc. D'achery,</hi> in the old Norman Tongue. <hi>Spicil. Tom.</hi> XII <hi>p.</hi> 583, 584, 585. as it is to be read in <hi>Matthew Paris ad An.</hi> 1215.</p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:55979:51"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> We find that the opinion of the Engliſh Nation of old was, That they could not only reſiſt their Prince, which abuſed his Authority, but wholly deprive him of it, by driving him and his wicked Councellors out of the Kingdom; as we ſee in <hi>Matth. Paris,</hi> in the Year 1233, where he relates, that <hi>Henry</hi> III, having call'd a Parliament, upon the Complaints that came in from all Parts againſt his Miniſters, and the Strangers, whoſe Service he made uſe of in the management of the Affairs of the Kingdom, the Members of the ſaid Parliament per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that they could not with ſafety meet together, refuſed to come up; <hi>Denunciantes Regi per nuncios ſolennes, quatenus omni dilatione remota ejiceret,</hi> by ſolemn Meſſengers requiring the King, that without any delay he ſhould turn out thoſe Strangers.</p>
                     <p n="3">3ly, They judged that if the Sword of St. <hi>Edward,</hi> called <hi>Curtana,</hi> ſignified, that the King reſerved to himſelf the Right of exerciſing Juſtice againſt Delinquents; yet he was liable to the ſame Penalties with private Perſons, whenever he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs'd the Laws of the State, whereof he was the Keeper and Defender, as the ſame <hi>Matth. Paris</hi> explains it in the Life of <hi>Henry</hi> III. much after the ſame manner as <hi>Aurelius Victor</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports in the Life of <hi>Trajan,</hi> That that Emperor underſtood the Ceremony of delivering the Sword to the Prefect of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torium.</p>
                     <p>Surely if we conſider our Hiſtory, we ſhall find,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Kings alone never had the Power of making Laws.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That they had no Power to lay Taxes on the People.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That they had not always the Power of making Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That they had not the Right of waging War, without the Advice of Parliament, as is obſerved by <hi>Philip de Commines,</hi> Lib. 4. cap. 1.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That as they were choſen by the People, they had alſo Power to depoſe them. <hi>Nennius</hi> the moſt ancient Engliſh Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian after <hi>Gildas,</hi> tells us, That <hi>Vortigerne</hi> was depoſed by <hi>St. Germain,</hi> and the Council of the <hi>Britains,</hi> becauſe he had
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55979:51"/> married his own Daughter, who placed his Son <hi>Vortimer</hi> upon the Throne. <hi>Edward</hi> II. <hi>Richard</hi> II.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That the States have cut off the Succeſſion, may be ſeen by <hi>Henry</hi> VII.</p>
                     <p>Indeed we find that our Ancient Lawyers, our Miniſters of State, and our Kings, who of all Men ought well to underſtand the Form and Conſtitution of our Kingdom, were ſo far from believing that the Royalty in <hi>England</hi> was an Abſolute and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Government, that they have expreſly declared that it is a Government bounded by Fundamental and Eſſential Laws, and compoſed of a mixture of Monarchy, Ariſtocracy, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy. See how <hi>Bracton</hi> expreſſeth himſelf to this purpoſe, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 16. <hi>Fleta l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 17. <hi>In populo regendo Rex habet Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riores, Legem per quam factus eſt Rex, &amp; Curiam ſuam, viz. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites &amp; Barones: Comites dicuntur quaſi Socii Regis, &amp; qui habet Socium habet Magiſtrum; &amp; ideo ſi Rex fuerit ſine fraeno, id eſt ſine Lege, debent ei fraenum ponere.</hi> In Ruling the People, the King has above him the Law, by which he is made King, and his High Court, <hi>viz.</hi> the Earls and Barons; Earls are ſo called as being the King's Companions; and he who has a Companion, has a Maſter; and therefore if the King be without Bridle, that is, without Law, they muſt bridle him.</p>
                     <p>Chancellor <hi>Forteſcue</hi> ſaith, <q>That the King cannot alter the Laws of his Kingdom, for he governs his People, not only by a Regal, but a Political Power; when it is ſaid the Prince's Will has the Force of a Law, this (ſaith he) is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of a Regal or Abſolute Power, from which a political Power much differs, for ſuch can neither change the Law, nor charge the People with new Impoſitions, againſt their Wills.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is a thing ſo notorious that <hi>Philip de Commines</hi> has taken notice of it in his Memoires, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. and elſewhere; as alſo <hi>Polydore,</hi> lib. 11.</p>
                     <p>Neither have thoſe only, who have expreſly treated of the Government of <hi>England,</hi> as Secretary <hi>Smith,</hi> conſider'd our Monarchy as a Government mix'd and bounded; but <hi>Charles</hi> I himſelf ſpake of it in theſe terms: <q>There being three
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55979:52"/> kinds of Government, abſolute Monarchy, Ariſtocracy, and Democracy, and all having particular Conveniences and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences; the experience and Wiſdom of our Anceſtors hath ſo moulded this out of a mixture of thoſe, as to give this Kingdom the Conveniences of all three, without the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences of any one, as long as the ballance hangs even between the three Eſtates, and they run jointly in their proper Channels. The ill of abſolute Monarchy, is Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; of Ariſtocracy, Faction and Diviſion; of Democracy, Tumults, Violence, and Licentiouſneſs. The Good of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy is uniting a Nation under one Head; the good of Ariſtocracy, is the conjunction of Counſel in the ableſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the Publick Good; the good of Democracy, is Liberty, and the Courage and Induſtry which Liberty begets. The Lords being truſted with Judicatory power, are an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Skreen and Bank, between the Prince and the People, by juſt Judgment to preſerve the Law: wherefore the Power of puniſhing is already in your hands according to Law.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let any one judg after all this, whether our Anceſtors ever entertain'd any of thoſe pernicious Maxims, maintain'd by ſome of our Modern Divines, Maxims that have been the fruitful Mother of Tyrants: <hi>viz.</hi> That Princes can diſpoſe of the Goods, Body, and Lives of their Subjects at their pleaſure; That they are not ſubject to Laws, or to give any Accompt; That their Succeſſion to the Throne, is by Nature and Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not at all by the Authority or Approbation of the States; That neither their Merits or Demerits can be brought into conſideration, to alter any thing about the Right of their Succeſſion, which is unalterable, That without precipitating our ſelves into eternal Condemnation, we may not oppoſe their Deſigns, though directly and openly level'd at the Ruin of the State, and the Change of Religion: In a word, that they may commit all manner of Injuſtice and Violence they pleaſe, and that ſafely and ſecurely, becauſe none but God alone can puniſh them.</p>

                     <p>They alledge in the firſt place the Title of <hi>Imperial</hi> given to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> which, in their Judgments, ſeems to equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize our Kings with the Roman Emperors; and to attribute an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Empire or Dominion to them: concerning which I have already ſhewed, that tho this Title were well grounded, yet the conſequence they draw from thence would be null, whether we conſider the antient Roman Empire, or whether we conſider the Empire, as it is now in <hi>Germany.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I add here for a further clearing of this Matter, that the ſame thing happened to the Kings of the Weſt, with regard to the Emperor of the Weſt, as befell the other Kings, who roſe after the Deſtruction of the Roman Empire, and to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of <hi>Germany,</hi> with reſpect to the Emperors of the Eaſt. The Emperors of the Eaſt, as appears from the Embaſſy of <hi>Luit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prand</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> could not endure that other Princes ſhould take upon them the Title of (<gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>) Kings, or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, believing that the Name of Kings, left them in ſome dependence upon the Empire of the Eaſt: this obliged the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55979:53"/> of the Weſt, to take upon them the Title of Emperor, to intimate their independency upon the Princes of the Eaſt. Which Title the Emperors of the Weſt having afterwards made uſe of, as a pretence, to raiſe themſelves above the reſt of the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> the Weſtern Kings did the ſame which the Emperors of the Weſt had done before, to aſſert their Independency.</p>
                     <p>For not only the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> but ſome other Weſtern Kings, have taken upon them the Title of Emperors.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alphonſus</hi> VI, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> took upon him this Title by a Conceſſion from Pope <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> II, becauſe he had ſuppreſſed the Moſorabick-Office: <hi>Alphonſus</hi> VII, and VIII, aſſum'd the ſame Titles, and <hi>Alphonſus</hi> VIII, was Crowned in that quality by <hi>Raymond</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> in the Church of <hi>Lions,</hi> with the conſent of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> II, as is reported by <hi>Garibay lib.</hi> 8. <hi>hiſt. cap.</hi> 4. We find that <hi>Peter de Clugny,</hi> writes to this <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> as Emperor of <hi>Spain, Epiſt.</hi> 8. And long time before theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it is certain that the Kings of the <hi>Goths,</hi> ſince <hi>Richaredus,</hi> had taken to themſelves the Title of <hi>Flavians,</hi> in imitation of the Roman Emperors; as may be ſeen in the Councils of <hi>Toledo.</hi> Yet <hi>Philip</hi> II, having demanded this Title in 1564 of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> IV, it was refuſed him.</p>
                     <p>The Kings of <hi>Lombardy</hi> had aſſum'd the Title of <hi>Flavians,</hi> even ſince <hi>Autlaric,</hi> according to the Account given us by <hi>Paul Diacon. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 8, which they did to ſhew, that they were Emperors in their own Lands and Territories, and that they acknowledged no Soveraign or Superior.</p>
                     <p>And it ſeems that in Proceſs of Time, ſome Weſtern Kings affected that Title for the ſame reaſon; and were the rather perſwaded ſo to do, becauſe ſome Canoniſts and Lawyers, have impudently maintained, That the Kings of <hi>Spain, France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> were Subjects of the Emperors of the Weſt. <hi>Gloſſa in cap.

                     <p>And thus much for the firſt Illuſion ſome make uſe of to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> poſſeſs the ſame Rights as the Emperors. A ſecond which ſeems to have ſome more Ground is this: They ſay that as the Emperors that were after <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> had the Right to divide the Empire, and to ſettle it by their Wills on their Heirs, the Kings of <hi>England</hi> having done the like; it appears thereby, they were in Poſſeſſion of the ſame Right the Emperors had: to this purpoſe they alledge the laſt Will of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, in favor of his Son <hi>William Rufus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But nothing can be more vain than this Objection.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We cannot deny, but that the Election of Kings took Place, during the Reign of the <hi>Saxons;</hi> not that they did it with that Freeneſs, as to prefer the Uncle before his Nephew, that was under Age 'tho the Kings Son, and the youngeſt Brother before the Eldeſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly, It is true that <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror did act in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner, in diſpoſing of his Kingdom in Favor of <hi>William Rufus,</hi> in the ſame way as one diſpoſeth of a Conqueſt (and this in prejudice to <hi>Robert</hi> his Eldeſt Son) as was alſo done by <hi>William Rufus.</hi> But theſe two Princes dying without Heirs, <hi>Henry,</hi> who had Married the Daughter of King <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> who had the Rights of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, and who in Conſideration of that Marriage, renounced the Rights he might pretend to <hi>England,</hi> as heir Preſumptive of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, having obtain'd the Government by the Right of his Wife, the Laws recovered their Strength, and Things returned to their antient Channel, as they were in the time of the <hi>Saxons.</hi> So that it appears that it is Folly for any one to imagine that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> may alienate their Eſtates, as a private Perſon can alienate his Inheritance. This was evident in the caſe of King <hi>John,</hi> who was oppoſed by the whole State, for pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſubject the Crown of <hi>England</hi> to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> III.</p>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:55979:54"/>
                     <p>And indeed if we conſider the Thing in it ſelf, and according to the unanimous Opinion of all Lawyers, theſe laſt Wills can really be of no Force, without the conſent of the States, to authorize them, as we find that the ſame did intervene in both the fore-mentioned Caſes. The reaſon whereof is invincible, foraſmuch as all States do not conſider their Kings as Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of their Kingdoms, but only as publick Miniſters, who are intruſted with a Juriſdiction and Adminiſtration for the Good of the publick. And this is the Title by which even Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors themſelves are at laſt obliged to hold their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                     <p>They tell us in the 3d place, that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titling themſelves Kings <hi>by the Grace of God:</hi> it appears that their Power being come from God, cannot be limited by their Subjects, over whom God has ſet them. A wonderful way of arguing, and never known till theſe our Times: at leaſt, it is evident, that he who has defended <hi>Nicholas de Lyra</hi> againſt <hi>Burgenſis,</hi> hath made a very different uſe of theſe words, <hi>Dei Gratia,</hi> by the Grace of God, wherewith the Kings of the North prefac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> their Titles, from what ſome now a days make of it. For he maintains that it is the Character of a limited and temper'd Government: ſee how he expreſſeth himſelf upon the 8. <hi>ch.</hi> of the 1 Book of <hi>Kings. Titulus Imperatoris modo regendi vitiato</hi> (that is to ſay, <hi>illimitato,</hi> as he expreſſes himſelf before) <hi>contradicit; nam titulus ejus eſt,</hi> N. Dei gratia Romanorum Rex &amp; ſemper Auguſtus, <hi>hoc eſt Reipublicae non privatae accommodus. Ita &amp; aliorum Regum Proteſtationes ſunt ſub Dei gratia quae vitiatum Principatum non admittit.</hi> The very Title of the Emperor, ſaith he, is a Contradiction to an Arbitrary and Unlimited kind of Government; for his Title is, N. <hi>by the Grace of God, King of the</hi> Romans, <hi>always</hi> Auguſtus (that is enlarger of the Empire) which implies that his Government is accommodate to the Common good and not his Private Intereſt. So likewiſe we find that the Proteſtations of other Kings are under <hi>Dei Gratia</hi> (the Grace of God) which doth not admit of Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:55979:54"/>
                     <p>There remain but two difficulties more; the firſt is this, Several Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> having perſwaded the People, that a neceſſity was laid upon them to ſuffer all from the Hands of their Kings; The Kings of <hi>England</hi> have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly uſurped thoſe Rights, and were actually in poſſeſſion of them, when the ſame began to oppoſe themſelves to King <hi>James;</hi> this is that they call a right of Preſcription. They conſider the State, as having loſt its Liberty, ſince their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to the Eſtabliſhment of Tyranny, and conſequently having no right to attempt any thing towards the Recovery of it.</p>
                     <p>But I deſire thoſe who fain would obtrude this Deluſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, as they have upon themſelves, to conſider,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That known Maxime of Right, <hi>Poſſeſſor malae fidei non praeſcribit,</hi> An unjuſt Poſſeſſor makes no Praeſcription. Indeed if this be true, That a Man needs only uſurp the Goods and Rights of another, to make himſelf the lawful Maſter of them; Robbers, Uſurers, and thoſe who by abuſing of the Law deprive others of their Rights, will be found to be of the beſt and moſt thriving Trades in the World. If this be ſo, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Pope, by the Poſſeſſion they have been in for ſo many Ages, muſt carry it by Preſcription, to hang, burn, and maſſacre; neither can any one oppoſe himſelf againſt their juſt Title.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They ought to conſider that if Kings be accounted Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors or under Age, becauſe they cannot alienate their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, as being only granted them for the good of the State, the People are ſo, on a much better Title, and Preſcription can never prejudice them.</p>
                     <p>I know it is a Maxime in Law, <hi>Praetor cum injuſtè judicat, jus dicit;</hi> that a Judg, though he judges unjuſtly, his Judgment ſtands good in Law, and accordingly muſt be obey'd: from whence ſome might conclude, That the moſt unjuſt Kings can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55979:55"/> be contradicted, and that it is unlawful for any to oppoſe themſelves to their Deciſions. But thoſe who ſhould make this Objection, probably would not take notice of the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it. It is for the Intereſt of the Society, that the Judgments pronounced by the ordinary Judges ſhould be valid, though ſome of their Judgments may be unjuſt: but no body ever believed, that this Maxime authorizeth the Magiſtrate, either Subaltern or Soveraign, to tread under-feet the Laws, and to make publick Profeſſion to judg all things according to their fancy. 2ly. 'Tis a conſtant truth, That Kings could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver juſtly touch the Peoples Rights, they being commiſſionated neither by God nor Man to judg what be the Rights of the People, and having no more right to deprive them thereof than a party at Law, has right to deprive his party of the Right that juſtly belongs to him.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> An Anſwer to the laſt Objection.</head>
                     <p>AFter all that hath been ſaid, I cannot ſuſpect that any ſhould make an Objection, that has ſo little Appearance of any Probability, as is that which is the 2d of thoſe that remain to be examined by me; ſome ſuppoſe their conceit to be of ſome weight, who urge the Acts of Parliament under King <hi>Charles</hi> II, as deſtructive of this form of the Engliſh Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Words are theſe; <hi>That it is not lawful on any Pretence whatſoever to take up Arms againſt the King,</hi> &amp;c. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it cannot be denied but that theſe Words ſeem to ſuppoſe, that thoſe who ſwear to them, cannot believe it is lawful to take up Arms againſt the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> howſoever they may behave themſelves, nor by any oppoſition to hinder the overturning of the Laws and Government. We may well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg that Power to be unbounded, which it is not lawful to oppoſe by force of Arms; now theſe Acts of Parliament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that it is not lawful to reſiſt the King; wherefore the King of <hi>England</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed an unlimited and abſolute Monarch, and by Conſequence we muſt conclude, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>England</hi> is wholly changed and deſtroyed; ſo that whatſoever we have alledged in the foregoing Diſcourſe, can only be made uſe of as a Hiſtory of what is paſt, but not as a Rule or Precedent for what is to come.</p>
                     <p>This conceit is ſo unreaſonable, that it ſeems ſcarce worth the pains to ſtop at it; however I ſhall endeavour in few Words to ſatisfy thoſe who ſeem unwarily to be taken in the Snare, which the Malice of a Popiſh Court had laid for them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt. They muſt know that the Fundamental Laws of any State, are of the Nature of Contracts, Pactions and Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55979:56"/> which according to the common opinion of Lawyers are irrevocable. <hi>Buxtorf. in Bull. aurea cap.</hi> 1. § 7. whence it follows, That all Oaths that are taken againſt Capitulations of this nature, may be Sins to thoſe who take them, but cannot oblige them, as being unlawful Oaths.</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly. They cannot ſuppoſe that the Parliaments of <hi>Charles</hi> II did ever think of repealing theſe Fundamental Laws, without accuſing the Members that compoſed them of having been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicators and betrayers of the Intereſt of their Country, by changing the limited Monarchy into a true Tyranny.</p>
                     <p n="3">3ly. They cannot do this Injury to theſe illuſtrious Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, without caſting the ſame Blemiſh upon the Biſhops, in the Houſe of Lords, during thoſe Seſſions of Parliament, and making them altogether odious either for their Stupidity, or for their Malice: for their Stupidity, if imprudently they gave their conſent to Laws made on purpoſe to change the Kingly Government into Tyranny; or for their Malice, if they wilfully betrayed the Intereſt of the State, though they knew well enough what muſt be the end and aim of theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations. I deſire theſe Gentlemen to make ſome Reflection on this truth. Is it poſſible they ſhould have no Conſideration at all, either for the Reputation or Conſcience of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. They have ſhewed themſelves ſo jealous of a change in the form of the Government, by making of a ſucceſſive State, an Elective one, and yet they ſuppoſe that the Parliament and the Biſhops that ſat in them have in ſport changed the form of the Government, by making it of a limited Royalty, to become an abſolute and unbounded Monarchy.</p>
                     <p n="4">4ly, They muſt needs accuſe theſe Parliaments of a ſtrange Folly; for theſe Gentlemen ſuppoſe that the Diſorders which then ruled in the State, obliged the Parliament to reſtore <hi>Charles</hi> II. They ſuppoſe that the Anarchy and various Sects which had the upper hand before his recall; making wiſe Men not without cauſe to apprehend the Ruine of the Proteſtant Religion, as well as the Overthrow of the State, they thought
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55979:56"/> themſelves obliged to employ all their ſtrength, for reſtoring of <hi>Charles</hi> II. as ſuppoſing him a good Proteſtant and a King whom his Adverſities had made wiſe, in hopes of being go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by him according to the ancient Laws of the Kingdom. And yet after this they will perſwade us, That the Parliament thought it fit and reaſonable, to deſtroy the Nature of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty in <hi>England,</hi> by making it Miſtreſs of the Laws, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing it to deſtroy the Proteſtant Religion, whenever the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Faction ſhould think fit to have it done.</p>
                     <p n="5">5ly. They muſt accuſe theſe Parliaments of the commiſſion of a horrid piece of Imprudence, in attempting upon the Liberty of the People: For if this were indeed their Deſign, were they not obliged at the ſame time to repeal all the other Laws which reſtrain the Power of the Kings of <hi>England?</hi> For we know that a Law cannot be valid nor derogate from other Laws, except in the ſaid Law expreſs mention be made of the ſaid Derogation with a Notwithſtanding to the Reglements ſet down in other Laws that are in Authority on that Subject. <hi>De Decimis c. nuper.</hi> Ought not they alſo in like manner to have declared, and that very preciſely too, that they diſpenſed <hi>Charles</hi> II from keeping his Coronation-Oath, and to have ſet down in very diſtinct terms, that in caſe the King ſhould think fit to call in an Army of French Dragoons to raviſh their Wives and Daughters, and to force all his Subjects to change their Religion, they do not think it lawful to take up Arms againſt him or them, for to repel their Violence.</p>
                     <p n="6">6ly. They are to take notice that <hi>Charles</hi> II did never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that thoſe Acts had changed the Government of the State. Do we not know that he offered to the Parliaments of <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> to impoſe ſuch Conditions on the D. of <hi>York,</hi> as the Parliament ſhould judg neceſſary, provided only the Succeſſion might be aſſured to him: now could any thing be more ridiculous and extravagant than this Propoſition of the King, had he believed that the Acts already paſt in his Favour, had given him and his Succeſſors a Right to overturn all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being able to be challenged or oppoſed by any one for ſo
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55979:57"/> doing? They themſelves did ſuppoſe the ſame thing, and went upon that Ground; what elſe could be their meaning in Crowning <hi>James</hi> II, if they ſuppoſed that he was in full and rightful Poſſeſſion of the Government by virtue of the Succeſſion, without being obliged to take the Oaths, by which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> oblige themſelves to keep the Laws of the State.</p>
                     <p n="7">7ly. They ought to take notice, that they themſelves ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the Fundamental Laws of the State were not aboliſhed. I don't ſpeak here of thoſe loud Murmurs that were heard every where, when <hi>James</hi> II by an Act of his Council, of his own Authority raiſed the ſame Sums, which had been granted to <hi>Charles</hi> II which he could not do without the Authority of Parliament; nor of the Complaints that were generally made when he turned out my Lord <hi>Clarendon</hi> from being Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty of <hi>Ireland,</hi> baniſh'd ſeveral Proteſtant Lords out of his Council, and put Papiſts into all Offices whether Civil or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary. I only take notice here of the Petition preſented in the Name of the Clergy by the ſeven Biſhops upon occaſion of reading the Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience; for had they been of another opinion, with what pretence of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon could they have complained of <hi>James</hi> II, governing with an Arbitrary Power, and his diſpenſing with the Laws? Why in their Petition did they alledg thoſe Acts of Parliament which had condemn'd that Power in 1673, when <hi>Charles</hi> II publiſhed his Proclamation for Liberty of Conſcience. Theſe Acts of theirs, upon this Suppoſal, could not be accounted of other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, than as Acts of Rebellion, nor could they be made uſe of with a good Conſcience, after they had been convinc'd that the Fundamental Laws being repealed and aboliſhed, they were now ſubject to an arbitrary and unbounded Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                     <p>Indeed we cannot enough commend the Conſtancy of the Clergy and thoſe worthy Prelates, who refuſed to read the Declaration of <hi>James</hi> II for Liberty of Conſcience: that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration being grounded upon the Power he attributed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55979:57"/> of diſpenſing with the Laws. But on the other Hand nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we imagine any more convincing Proof to make out that at that Time they did not conceive, any more than the whole State, who ſo generally applauded them, that they themſelves, as well as the whole State, had caſt themſelves headlong into Slavery by their Oaths, becauſe the Power of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> was become unbounded and Arbitrary.</p>
                     <p>In a Word, how ample an extent ſoever theſe Gentlemen may give to the Oath they have taken in purſuance of an Act of Parliament in the 13 Year of <hi>Charles</hi> II, they muſt remember one Thing which is always ſuppoſed, which is the natural Condition of all Oaths, <hi>rebus ſic ſtantibus, c. ad naturam,</hi> Things continuing in the ſame State; for indeed as ſoon as things have changed their Nature, or that Circumſtances are altered, there remains no more Obligation in Caſes, where exceptions are naturally ſuppoſed. I am bound to Obey my Father in all Things, this being what the Scripture expreſly teacheth me; but I am not bound to Obey him any farther, than he Acts like a Father, neither am I oblig'd to keep this Command of obeying him in all Things, but only ſo far as the Things enjoyned by him are juſt and lawful. I am bound to obey the King accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Laws, neither may I lawfully reſiſt Him, in his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of the Laws, or upon any pretext whatſoever take up Arms againſt him: but if in ſtead of governing according to Law, he uſeth his utmoſt Endeavours to overthrow the Society, by deſtroying the Laws which are the Band of it, then all the Oaths I have taken are no longer of any Force, 'tis my Right to Endeavour to preſerve the Society, which he goes about to overthrow, and to oppoſe his Violence by taking up Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and to put a ſtop to the unjuſt Proceedings of a Prince, who declares himſelf an Enemy to the State, by the ways which providence affords me for my Security.</p>
                     <p>But if after all theſe Conſiderations, theſe Gentlemen will ſtill maintain, that they have taken theſe Oaths in ſo ſtrait a Senſe, that nothing is capable of ſatisfying their Conſciences; we have great Reaſon to be Aſtoniſhed, how it was poſſible
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55979:58"/> that Men of ſo Tender and Delicate a Conſcience, could take ſuch Oaths, which taken in their Senſe do viſibly overturn both the State and Religion. Indeed there is no need of any ones being a Prophet to make him conceive, that they were rather obliged in Conſcience to refuſe the taking of ſuch Oaths, and to fly to the End of the World, rather than take them, than they are bound to keep them, with the hazard of the utter Ruin of their Native Country and their Religion; or ſee them Periſh without having any Power to Defend them, as they are obliged by the Laws of nature, and by all the Duties of the Society and Religion.</p>
                     <p>It has already been made out by ſeveral Writings, that God ſeeming to ſpare and wink at the weakneſs of thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd themſelves thus faſt bound and tied by their Oaths, and deſtin'd to become Victimes to Popery and Tyranny, has been pleas'd happily to deliver them from the trouble wherein they had involed themſelves in ſending them a Deliverer, whoſe Rights, in a War which <hi>James</hi> II. unjuſtly wageth againſt him, are above all thoſe Difficulties, which ſeem to be matter of Scruple to them: ſo that it is not needful for me to inſiſt any longer on this Matter.</p>

                     <p>I Am perſwaded, that every equal Reader cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that to judg aright of Things, the Proceedings of <hi>England,</hi> with reſpect to <hi>James</hi> II. have been the moſt juſt and lawful that could be.</p>
                     <p>The Things I have made out in this Treatiſe, are ſummarily contain'd in the following Articles.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Conſtitution and Eſtabliſhment of any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is the Effect of the Original Conſent of the People, though the Authority of the Magiſtrates be a Thing eſtabliſhed by God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That this Eſtabliſhment ſuppoſeth the Subſiſtence of the Laws, which are the End of the Government in the Deſign of God; for indeed Kingdoms without Juſtice, are no better than great Robberies, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls them, <hi>De Civit. Dei, Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That theſe Fundamental Laws, for the Subſiſtence of the Society, are a Bond which ſo ſtrictly ties the Soveraigns, that nothing is able to diſpenſe with their Obligation to them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That when the Soveraigns do violate them, they break the Ties, whereby their Subjects are bound to their Lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That the Subjects can never be deprived of their Right to hinder the Ruin of the Society, and of the Laws, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of which only they have put their Rights into the Hands of the Prince.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That there was never any State that ſubſiſted under other conditions than theſe.</p>
                     <p n="7">
                        <pb n="98" facs="tcp:55979:59"/>7. That <hi>England</hi> in particular, and <hi>Scotland,</hi> have always had this Right.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe Things ſuppoſed, it is evident,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>James</hi> II. has forfeited all his Rights to the Crown, even before his Deſertion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the Lords and People juſtly took up Arms againſt him, to oblige him by Force to reform the Diſorders he had cauſed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the States had Power, without any regard had to Him, to raiſe the King and Queen to the Throne.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That the Subjects are more than enough freed from their Oath of Allegiance to King <hi>James.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. That they have Right, and are under Obligation, to take up Arms, and oppoſe themſelves againſt <hi>James</hi> II. and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Authority of the King and Queen.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That thoſe who oppoſe themſelves to this, are declared Enemies of the State, and of our Religion, and the Authors and Abettors of Tyranny and Popery.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That thoſe who pretend themſelves ſcrupulous in theſe Points, are the Cauſe of the Diviſion, and conſequently of the Ruin of the State and Religion, whereby they grievouſly ſin againſt God, and therefore are obliged in Conſcience to repent and make amends for the Miſchief their Diviſion has cauſed.</p>
                     <p>The thing is very evident, and foraſmuch as it is of the higheſt importance for their Salvation, I beg of them well to weigh and conſider theſe following Articles, and witneſs their Repentance in all theſe reſpects.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Then they ought to repent, for that they making profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to have ſo ſtrong an Affection for <hi>James</hi> II. they have made him fall upon the Deſigns of changing the Government into a Deſpotical and Arbitrary Power, and thus by their Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims have advanced and precipitated his Ruin. They are the Men who have made him conceive the Deſign of eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing a Tyranny in <hi>England;</hi> they have given birth to his hope of being able to compaſs it according to his Hearts deſire, and his Ruin proceeding from the oppoſition that was made
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55979:59"/> againſt theſe his Deſigns, 'tis them he may thank for all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries into which he is plunged; and conſequently they have great reaſon to repent, for having precipitated his Ruin by their falſe and deceitful Foundation. See what <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſaith, <hi>In opuſc. contr. Adulat. conſid.</hi> 10. <hi>Clericus ille Regem ſuum aut Principem amaret minimè, qui perverſas, &amp; tales vellet dare doctrinas, aut toto poſſe &amp; ſcientia illas non impediret—quia non eſt modus certior, quo Rex aut Princeps ſe perderet in corpore &amp; in anima, totamque ejus damnationem, quam habendo falſas tales opiniones, &amp; eas opere exequendo. Cur? Quoniam Dominatio ſua in Tyrannidem vertere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur &amp; in infidelitatem.</hi> That Clergy-man would be far from loving his King or Prince, who ſhould teach him ſuch perverſe and falſe Doctrines, or that with all his Power and Skill ſhould not oppoſe them; becauſe there is not a more ſure way for a Prince to deſtroy himſelf, Soul and Body, and to procure his total Damnation, than by entertaining ſuch falſe Opinions, and reducing them into practice. Why ſo? Becauſe his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by this means would be changed into Tyranny and Perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They ought to repent, for their having contributed ſo much towards the eſtabliſhing of Tyranny, not only becauſe that would have deſtroyed the Publick Liberty, but becauſe his Deſign at the ſame time was, to overthrow the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ſubſtitute in the place of it the Idolatry, Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Tyranny of Popiſh Uſurpation. This was a thing they could not do without imitating the Conduct of the Popiſh Clergy, who ſince the Popes have undertaken to tread under their Feet the Rules of the Goſpel, and of the Church, have endeavoured to inſpire Princes with an indifferency for their Oaths, and contempt of the Laws, which are a Safeguard and Security of the Civil Society.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They muſt repent, at leaſt ſome of them, for having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately endeavoured to hide and diſguiſe the Conſpiracies which were deſign'd for the Ruin of our Religion and Liberty.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They muſt repent for having writ in favour of an Opinion contrary to the Judgment of the Ancient Reformers of <hi>England;</hi> and for having traduc'd, as Rebels, the Proteſtant Churches beyond the Sea, for their maintaining the Maxims which the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55979:60"/> firſt Reformers of <hi>England</hi> have Aſſerted, and for which they have Writ, in defence of their Proteſtant Brethren.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. They muſt repent, for that by their Sermons and Writings they have inſinuated to the People thoſe Maxims which have put them upon betraying the Natural Rights of the Society, and in the Sequel, upon imprudently expoſing themſelves to betray the Intereſt of the Proteſtant Religion, which they were obliged to deliver ſafe to their Poſterity.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. They muſt repent, for having by this means encouraged the Judges to tread underfoot the Authority of the Laws, and to diſpence with them, as having taught them to look upon the Laws, as the Conceſſions of Princes, and Acts of their Will, and by Conſequence revocable at their good Pleaſure.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. They muſt repent, at leaſt ſome of them, for having mounted to Eccleſiaſtical Dignities, by publickly appearing in the Liſts for defence of theſe pernicious and tyrannical Maxims, directly level'd at the Ruin and Overthrow of our Liberty and Religion.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. They muſt repent, for that their Opinions at this Day are the Cauſes of the preſent Conſpiracies, Rebellions and Treaſons againſt the Government, by which God has been pleas'd ſo graciouſly to ſecure our Liberty and Religion, from the inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Ruin wherewith they were threatned.</p>
                     <p>However, we have cauſe to bleſs God, that thoſe who are guilty of theſe Sins, are but inconſiderable in their Numbers. And I ardently wiſh for them, they may once ſeriouſly enter into themſelves, and that by the Example of their Brethren, they may, for Time to come, employ all their Endeavours to make reparation for the Miſchief and Scandal their Errors and Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices have in a great meaſure brought both upon the Church and State.</p>

                              <p>AFter ſome Ordinances and Decrees made by us, with reſpect to the Eccleſiaſtical Order, and their particular Diſcipline, the laſt Reſolution taken by us Prieſts, is to enact a final Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical Decree for the puiſſance of our Kings, and the ſtability of the Gothick Nation, in preſence of the Great Judge of the World. For many Nations are ſo falſe and perfidious, that they make ſlight of the Oath of Faithfulneſs they have ſworn to their Kings, and tho with their mouths they profeſs Allegiance to their Prince, yet retain Perfidiouſneſs in their hearts: they ſwear indeed to their Kings, but are as ready to break it again upon occaſion, not fearing that Roll of Judgment, which brings a Curſe and manifold Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments upon thoſe who ſwear
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55979:62"/> falſly by the name of the Lord. What hope is there that ſuch as theſe ſhould either ſtand to their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulations in time of War, or obſerve their Treaties of Peace with other Nations? Or what Covenant or Contract will they not break? Or what Promiſe made to their Enemies will they keep, when they violate the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance ſworn to their own Kings? For who is ſo mad as to endeavour to cut off his Head with his own Hand? This is notorious, that unmindful of their own Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation they kill themſelves, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their force and violence againſt themſelves and their own Kings. And whereas the Lord ſaith, <hi>Touch not mine Anointed:</hi> and <hi>David, Who can ſtretch forth his hand againſt the Lords anointed and be guiltleſs?</hi> theſe are neither afraid of Perjury, or murthering their own Princes. Sure it is, that a Promiſe, tho made to Enemies, ought to be kept: Now if we muſt keep Faith and Truth in War to our Enemies, how much more are we to keep them on all other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions? For it is a piece of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge for Subjects to violate the Faith promiſed to their Kings, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                                 </gap>inſt God himſelf, in whoſe name they make their promiſe. Hence it comes that the wrath
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55979:62"/> of God doth oft change and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer many of the Earthly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, the breach of Faith and corruption of Manners, making way for the deſtruction and change of the Government. Wherefore alſo it ought to be our great care to avoid the miſhaps attending theſe Nations, leſt we be involved with them deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſame Puniſhment. Thus we ſee that God did not ſpare the Angels that rebell'd againſt him, who by their diſobedience forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Heavenly Manſions. Wherefore 'tis ſaid alſo by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, My Sword is made drunk in Heaven;</hi> how much more then ought we to ſtand in awe, and fear the ſame diſaster, leſt by our perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we be deſtroyed by the ſame Sword of an angry God. If therefore we deſire to avoid the divine wrath, and to have his ſeverity turn'd into Favour and Clemency towards us, let us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things with fear keep and obſerve to God the Religious Worſhip and Service we owe him, and to our Kings the Faith and Allegiance we have promis'd them: Let there not be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, as in ſome other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, any wicked contrivance of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfaithfulneſs, or cunning Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſneſs, or the horrid Crime of Perjury, or miſchievous Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Conſpiracies: Let none
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55979:63"/> amongſt us, egg'd on by Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, invade the Throne, or ſtir up Seditions amongſt his Fellow-Citizens, or compaſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive the Death of Kings: but when the King is departed this Life in Peace, let the Lords of the Nation, together with the Prieſts, by joint Advice and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, appoint and conſtitute a Succeſſor of the Kingdom; that ſo whilſt this band of Unity and Concord is thus preſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, none may endeavour to make a rent in the Kingdom by force or unjuſt ways. But in caſe this Admonition prove not of ſufficient force, to correct the bad impreſſions which may be on the minds of any, and to incline the hearts of all to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the common good, we think good to pronounce Sentence. Whoſoever therefore, either of us, or any of the People of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſhall by any Conſpiracy or Endeavour come to break and falſifie the Oath he has taken, for the good State and Welfare of the <hi>Gothick</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the ſafety of the King, or ſhall preſume to kill the King, or deprive him of his Royal Dignity, or by a Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical preſumption ſhall Uſurp the Throne, let him be Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma in the Eyes of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Holy Angels, and be caſt out of the Catholick Church
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55979:63"/> which he has profan'd by his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and be turn'd out from all Chriſtian Societies, together with all the Complices of his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, becauſe it is but juſt that they who are guilty of the ſame Crime ſhould be involved in the ſame puniſhment. Which therefore we think good to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat again; ſaying, Whoſoever from this time forwards, either of us, or of all the People of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſhall by any Conſpiracy or Endeavour, break the Oath which he has taken for the good State of his Native Country, and of the <hi>Gothick</hi> Nation, and for the ſafety of the King's Perſon, or ſhall preſume to kill the King, or deprive him of his Kingdom, or by a tyrannical preſumption ſhall Uſurp the Throne, let him be Anathema in the ſight of Chriſt and his Holy Apoſtles, and be caſt out of the Catholick Church, which he has profan'd by his Perjury, and thruſt out from all Chriſtian Societies, and as a damn'd Perſon be deliver'd up to the juſt Judgment of God to come, together with all his complices and partakers. Yea we repeat a third time, That whoſoever of us, or any of the People of <hi>Spain,</hi> in contrivance or deed, break his Oath which he hath taken for the good Sate and Welfare of his own Native Countrey, and the <hi>Gothick</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55979:64"/> and the ſafety and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the King's Perſon, or attempt the life of the King, or deprive him of his Royal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or by a tyrannical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption ſhall Uſurp the Throne, let him be Anathema in the ſight of the Holy Ghoſt and the Martyrs of Chriſt, and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated from the Catholick Church, which he has profaned by his Perjury, and be renounced all Chriſtian Communion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever having any ſhare or part with the Righteous, but with the Devil and his Angels be condemned to Eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with all his Partners joyn'd with him in the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, that the ſame puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of final perdition may reach all that are Complices and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the ſame guilt. Wherefore if this thrice repeated Sentence be according to the mind of all you that are here preſent, confirm the ſame with your Unanimous Voices. Accordingly the whole Body of the Clergy and People have ſaid and declared, Whoſoever ſhall preſume to do any thing againſt this your Decree, Let him be Anathema, Maranatha, that is, accurſt and damn'd at the coming of our Lord, and have his ſhare and lot with <hi>Judas Iſcariot,</hi> both they and their Complices. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>In conſideration therefore of the Premiſes, we Prieſts do admoniſh and warn the Holy Church of Chriſt, and all the People, to take care that this tremendous and ſo oft repeated Sentence of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication may not make any of us obnoxious to preſent and eternal
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55979:64"/> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, but that keeping the Faith we have ſworn to our moſt Glorious Lord, King <hi>Siſenandus,</hi> and ſerving him with ſincere Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, we may not only incline the Divine Clemency and Goodneſs towards us, but may alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the favour of our Gracious Prince. <hi>Amen.</hi>

That none of you alone may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to judge of Capital Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or any Mans Eſtate; but that by publick conſent of the Judges and other Magiſtrates, and in an open Tryal, the Guilt of Delinquents may be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, obſerving a merciful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition towards thoſe who have

And as to what belongs to all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Kings, we pronounce this our Sentence, that in caſe any of them without being reſtrain'd by the Reverence due to the Laws, ſhall by a proud Lordli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, being puft up with the Royal dignity, by injuſtice, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence and oppreſſion, exerciſe a tyranical and cruel Power againſt his Subjects, let all ſuch be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd and anathematiz'd by Chriſt, and be ſeparated from God, and ſubjected to his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for that he preſumed to act wickedly, and to endeavour the hurt and ruine of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And as for <hi>Suintilanus,</hi> who fearing the puniſhment of his Crimes, has deſerted the Kingdom, depriving himſelf thereby of the Royal Power, we, with the Conſent of the People, have Decreed that neither he nor his Wife nor Children, ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be received by us into our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, becauſe of the wickedneſs they are guilty of; or reſtored to

                  <head>AN ADVERTISEMENT Concerning the ARTICLES OF MAGNA CHARTA of King JOHN. As alſo concerning <hi>The</hi> MAGNA CHARTA <hi>now printed in this</hi> APPENDIX.</head>
                  <p>THESE <hi>Articles</hi> or <hi>Capitula</hi> were found in the Study of Biſhop <hi>Warner,</hi> late Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rocheſter:</hi> They were commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by a Gentleman of that Family to Mr. <hi>Geddis,</hi> and by him to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There can be no reaſonable ſcruple raiſed againſt the Authentickneſs or Truth of the Writing: For firſt,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is in a Hand very ancient: They that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent judges of ſuch Antiquities, ſay, It well preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the Time of which it treateth.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb facs="tcp:55979:67"/>2. It hath yet appendant the Seal of King <hi>John,</hi> without any ſuſpicion of being lately affixed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the famous Library of Sir <hi>John Cotton,</hi> there are now to be ſeen many private <hi>Charters</hi> of King <hi>John,</hi> which exactly agree with this, both in reſpect of the Writing, and alſo of the Seal.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the Books of the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> amongſt many things there entred, of the time of King <hi>John,</hi> theſe <hi>Articles</hi> are Recorded, and were thence tranſcribed, many Years before the Original of them came into the Hand of the Biſhop of <hi>Saliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. This Inſtrument is the ſame which <hi>Matth. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> mentioneth, <hi>Page</hi> 254. by the name of <hi>SCHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LA. Archiepiſcopus Schedulam illam,</hi> &amp;c. <q>The Arch-Biſhop, with others, bringing that Schedule to the King, recited before the King all the Capitula, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—</q> Which tho' the King then rejected, yet ſhortly after upon better Advice, He granted; as may be gathered from the next Page of <hi>Matth. Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Arguments may ſatisfie thoſe, who ſince the late mentioning of theſe <hi>Articles</hi> in the <hi>Paſtoral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of the Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> have had the Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to doubt of the Truth of the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to the ſubſtance of theſe Articles; It is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that they contain ſome part of the <hi>Rights</hi> of the Barons, due to them by the Unwritten or Common
<pb facs="tcp:55979:67"/> Law of the Land; which <hi>Rights,</hi> for more certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were in ſeveral Reigns drawn into Writing: And, for more obligatorineſs, into Charters, after the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the <hi>Normans.</hi> In the time of the <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> they were contained in the Laws of that King. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the <hi>Conqueror</hi> confirmed (to the old, and new Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons of his Inveſtiture according to Cuſtom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) the Laws of the <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> as appeareth by the Record in <hi>Ingulf,</hi> and other Teſtimonies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Theſe <hi>Articles,</hi> or the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> were recognized, and by Oath re-confirm'd by <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Rufus;</hi> no doubt, at His Coronation; or not long after. The old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Chronicle writeth thus, <hi>William Rufus by his Letters Summon'd the Biſhops, Earls and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons to St.</hi> Pauls, <hi>and there he Sware, and made to them Surety by Writing, to ſuſtain, and maintain the Right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. King <hi>Henry</hi> I. ratified theſe <hi>Rights.</hi> In his Charter we find in general, <hi>Lagam Edwardi Regis vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis reddo cum its emendationibus, quibus Pater meus eam emendavit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I reſtore to you the Law of King</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>as it was mended (or enlarged) by my Father, with the Advice of his Barons.</hi>
                  </p>

<pb facs="tcp:55979:68"/> 
                     <hi>The Charter of King</hi> Henry [the Firſt] <hi>contained cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Liberties and Laws of King</hi> Edward, <hi>granted to the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and the great Men; as alſo ſome Liberties ſuperadded by King</hi> Hen. I. And <hi>pag.</hi> 254. <hi>Capitula quoque legum &amp; libertatum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Heads (or Articles) of the Laws and Liberties which the Great Men deſired to be confirmed, are already entred, partly above in the Charter of</hi> Henry I. <hi>and partly were gathered out of the Old Laws of King</hi> Edward. The Hiſtorian ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of theſe very <hi>Articles</hi> here Printed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. 'Tis obſervable, That in theſe <hi>Articles,</hi> there is no care taken for the Liberties of the Church. The reaſon of which I conceive to be this: The Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men moſtly then held with the King. And the Hand of the King was moſt heavy upon the Laity, who framed theſe <hi>Articles,</hi> without the Clergy.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Theſe <hi>Articles</hi> provide nothing concerning the <hi>Summons</hi> and holding of the <hi>Common Council</hi> of the Realm. The reaſon whereof probably was this: The Barons of that time had introduced a Practice, of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to appoint the <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> of the Meeting of the <hi>Common Council</hi> of the Nation: At the granting of theſe very <hi>Articles,</hi> King <hi>John</hi> ſent to the Barons; <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t diem &amp; locum providerent congruum, ad haec omnia proſequenda. That they (the Barons) would appoint Time and Place for the concluding that matter.</hi> In the time of <hi>Henry</hi> III. (in whoſe Charter the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>de communi concilio habendo</hi> was omitted; and in whoſe time the Barons begun again to War) we find, that the Lords came unto the King and ſaid, <hi>He muſt ordain and ſee for the Welfare of the Realm,
<pb facs="tcp:55979:68"/> and then ſet the King a Day to meet at</hi> Oxenford, <hi>and there to hold a Parliament.</hi> So the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Chronicle. However, this grand Affair, as alſo that of the Church, were provided for in the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of King <hi>John.</hi> Whereby it further appears, That theſe <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> were but the Rudiments of that <hi>Charter,</hi> after further enlarged, upon further deliberation.</p>
                  <p>I COME now in the ſecond place to ſay a few things concerning the Perfect and Compleat <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of King <hi>John,</hi> here printed in <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was the Cuſtom of old Times to make three ſeveral Copies of Publick <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Charters.</hi> Of the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> we have one in <hi>Latin,</hi> in <hi>Matthew Paris.</hi> This in <hi>French</hi> (or old <hi>Norman</hi> Language) was kept in the Records of <hi>France,</hi> and thence Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed ſome years paſt by <hi>Luke Dachery,</hi> in his <hi>Spici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legium.</hi> That in <hi>Engliſh</hi> was ſent into all Counties, but as yet no Copy in this Language appeareth.</p>
                  <p>Thus alſo the Laws of <hi>Canute,</hi> and the <hi>Proviſions</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> (to mention no more) made in the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> III. were Publiſht in three Languages.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The very ſame Charter Publiſht in <hi>Latin</hi> by <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> is alſo extant in the Hiſtory of <hi>Rad. Niger,</hi> almoſt word for word; and alſo in two ſeveral Manuſcripts in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library; where alſo about twenty years paſt the very Original was to be ſeen.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of King <hi>John</hi> is not extant in any Record in the <hi>Tower,</hi> or elſewhere, as ſeveral
<pb facs="tcp:55979:69"/> affirm; nor the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of <hi>H.</hi> III. but only by <hi>Inſpeximus</hi> in the time of <hi>Edw.</hi> I. A thing much to be wondered at. <hi>Rudburne</hi> writeth of the Charters of <hi>Hen.</hi> I. <hi>Sublatae ſunt omnes variis fallaciis, exceptis tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus. All but three were embezel'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of King <hi>John,</hi> and that of <hi>Hen.</hi> III. are ſaid to be the very ſame; where as they do exceedingly differ, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomis</hi> hath partly obſerved, and may further appear to any that will compare them. <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> pag. 323. <hi>The Tenor of theſe Charters is fully ſet down, above, where our Hiſtory treateth of King</hi> John: <hi>So as the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of King</hi> John and <hi>Hen.</hi> III. <hi>are not found to differ in any thing.</hi> Theſe words are not the words of <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> but of <hi>Roger VVendover,</hi> (whom <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> often tranſcribeth very haſtily) in whoſe Hiſtory the Charter entred as King <hi>John</hi>'s, is exactly the ſame with that Charter of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As to that remarkable Article, <hi>Et ad habendum commune concilium Regni.— And to the holding the Commune Council of the Realm,</hi> &amp;c. I ſhall briefly ſay, 1. That it hath been left out of all the Charters after King <hi>John</hi>'s time, but is found in ſeveral Copys very Authentick, and particularly in the <hi>French</hi> Copy now here printed. 2. That this Article doth not, as ſome have written, give the Original to our Parliaments; for ſuch Parliaments (or <hi>communia concilia</hi>) were held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time. King <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt, after his return from the <hi>Holy VVar,</hi> ſummon'd a <hi>Common Council</hi> (or Parliament) at <hi>London,</hi> of the Clergy and Laity,
<pb facs="tcp:55979:69"/> where he demanded Council about his making War upon the King of <hi>France;</hi> Earl <hi>Roger</hi> anſwered for the whole Parliament, <hi>The Earls, Barons and Knights, will aid you, O King, with their Swords; the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, Biſhops, Citizens, Burgeſſes, and Eccleſiaſtick Perſons will aid you with Money; Abbates, Priors, and ſuch others will aid you with their Prayers.</hi> So the <hi>Engliſh Chron.</hi> And to omit others, an Inſtance of ſuch a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is found in the Annales of <hi>Burton,</hi> pag. 263. compared with page 265. <hi>King</hi> John <hi>call'd to</hi> Northampton <hi>all the Earls and Barons of</hi> England: it followeth, <hi>Pandulfus ſpake</hi> (at the ſame time) <hi>to the Earls, Barons and Knights, O that you,</hi> &amp;c. The Clergy indeed are not here mentioned, but were certainly preſent, becauſe the occaſion of that <hi>Council</hi> was to reſtore Peace to the <hi>Church and Kingdom,</hi> as <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> or as the Annaliſt of <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verly</hi> wordeth it, <hi>betwixt the King and the Archbiſhop.</hi> 3. I conceive the chief end of adding this Article, was to prevent the taking of <hi>Aids,</hi> (commonly called Talliage) or <hi>Eſcuage,</hi> by ſurprize, or by the conſent only of a few, which King <hi>John</hi> had lately done. For the ſummoning of the <hi>Commune concilium</hi> here is plainly limited to the <hi>Seſſing of Aids and Eſcuage:</hi> But the <hi>Mirror</hi> giveth another account of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Parliaments, worthy of Conſideration, <hi>page</hi> 225. where the Author refers us to higher times.</p>
                  <p>There is yet one Article more in this Charter of King <hi>John</hi> which deſerveth our regards, the rather becauſe it being lately alledged in the <hi>Paſtoral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> hath much ſcandalized ſome, with its ſupriſing Novelty.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:55979:70"/>
                  <p>The words are, <hi>Barones cum communia totius ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae gravabunt nos. The Barons with the Community of the Land, ſhall aggrieve, or diſtreſs us,</hi> &amp;c. But why ſhould this ſound uncouth to any, who have with Reflection peruſed the Hiſtories of this, or the Neighbouring Kingdoms, wherein the ſame Practice is frequently found. <hi>Andrew</hi> King of <hi>Hungary</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the ſame Liberty to his People, as may be ſeen at large in the <hi>Decrees of the Kings of</hi> Hungary, in the end of <hi>Bonfinius:</hi> Like Examples occur in the <hi>French</hi> Annales; and in the Annales of <hi>Waverly</hi> in the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> the Third, <hi>pag.</hi> 217.</p>
                  <p>If any will yet ſuſpect that <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> in this Point, hath not writ fairly, or that the <hi>Articles</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> are not to be relied on, (and ſome ſuch diſſatisfied People there are) then let them (if they can be believed deſirous of ſatisfaction) repair to the <hi>Red Book of Exchequer,</hi> where fol. 234. they may find the very ſame <hi>VVords,</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> granted, as before: Which Record cannot well be ſuſpected of being corrupted, becauſe it hath been always in good Cuſtody.</p>

And the King ſhall give publick and free Liberty for any man to ſwear that will, and ſhall never pohibit any to ſwear. And all thoſe of the Nation, who will voluntarily of their own accord, ſwear to the Five and twenty Barons, to diſtreſs the King with them, the King himſelf ſhall iſſue his Praecept, Commanding them to ſwear as aforeſaid.</p>

And in all matters referred to thoſe Five and twenty Barons, if they happen to be all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and differ amongſt themſelves, or if any of them being thereto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, will not or cannot come, what the major part of them ſhall agree upon and enjoyn ſhall be valid, as if all the Five and twenty had agreed in it. And the ſaid Five and twenty ſhall ſwear that they will faithfully obſerve and keep the Articles aforeſaid, and with all theit might cauſe them to be obſerved. Moreover the King ſhall give them the Securities of the Archbiſhop and Biſhops, and Maſter <hi>Pandulphus,</hi> that he will not obtain any thing from the Pope, whereby any of theſe Articles of Agreement may be revoked or diminiſhed. And if any ſuch thing be obtain'd, that it be reputed void and of none effect, nor ſhall ever be made uſe of.</p>
